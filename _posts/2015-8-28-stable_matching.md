This semester I am taking csc 282 - a course on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. In this class, we analyze various popular algorithms and techniques used in the computer science including greedy/dynamic algorithms, divide-and-conquer, graph algorithms, linear programming, and np algorihtms. During the the graph section, we covered an interesting class of algorithms which dealt with a particular type of graphs called matchings. By definition, matchings are graphs whose edges do not share a common verticies. A simple way to determine whether or not a grpah is a matching is to see if it is colorable. $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

On another note, I recently got a free chromebook and wanted to take a break from my personal research write something simple to put on the webstore.
