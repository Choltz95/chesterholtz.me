The [Moran Process][1] is a simple stochastic process used to describe finite populations[wikipedia].
I created a simply visualization of fundamental properties of an evolving population. Since color can be represented as a 6-digit hexadecimal number, we can generalize color to be representative of an agents DNA, and preform operations representing mutation, inheritence, selection, and crossover by altering the color of the agent.
