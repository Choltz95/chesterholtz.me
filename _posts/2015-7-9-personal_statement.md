I am a junior at [The University of Rochester Hajim School of Engineering][1] studying computer science and mathematics. I am interested in investing myself in projects which present challenges relating several sciences or technologies. I am currently seeking a summer internship, research position, or job in computer science.

I would like to continue a path of research in big data analysis and in developing software to interface with real-world data. Currently I am working on writting real time mapping visualization of occurances of global chaotic events. 

Along with computer science, I also have a love of physics and mathematics and I am especially interested in the application of game theory to political science. 

My previous website served as a portfolio to demonstrate my competence in several web technologies and frameworks, but grew to be quite bloated and unecessarily flashy. I decided to focus less on the website itself and instead to make a website which contained deep and meaningful content.

Since I am not much of a writter, updates to the blog portion of this website will not be consistent, and will most likely be composed of technical reports of projects and research I am involved in.
