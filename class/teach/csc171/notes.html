what do computers understand?
	1s and 0s

	At the most basic level, a computer is a bunch of electricity running around turning things on and off. 
	But electricity is really really fast, so it does that very quickly. To represent things being on or off, 
	we choose to represent it as 0's and 1's. That way, it makes math much more reasonable for us to understand. 
	It's just a different number system! While you and I were raised to count to ten, computers only count to 2 (base-10 vs. base-2 number systems).

	Legendary hackers like Steve Wozniak, or the scientists who first created assemblers, were able to write programs which consisted of just strings of numbers, 
	because they knew which numbers corresponded to which CPU instructions. 
	Kind of like how a skilled musical composer could compose a complex piece of music by just jotting down the notes on a staff, without ever sitting down at a piano and playing a single note.
	That's how they wrote the first assemblers. On early "home computers" like the Altair, you would do this sort of thing - turn on the computer, 
	and the first thing you'd do is toggle a bunch of switches in a complex sequence to "write" a program.
	Once an assembler was written and could be saved on permanent storage (like a tape drive) to be loaded later, 
	you could use that assembler to write a better assembler, and eventually you'd use it to write a compiler, and use that compiler to write a better compiler.

what is computer science?
	the study of modeling problems in terms of what a computer can understand

what computer science is not?
	Computer Science is not just about building computers or writing computer programs!

what is an algorithm?
	a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

what is a program?
	A list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. How we write these instructions depends on the language we are writting in...
	over the years layers of abstraction have allowed us to write programs without ever having to deal with the underlying complexities of low level computation.

methods and class structure
primitives
	numbers
	characters
	strings
	booleans
literals and expressions

operators
order?
and arithmetic

variables
	a storage location paired with a symbolic name - not helpful
	basically, an abstract identifier which has a value. In simple algebraic equations of the form ax = b, we refer to x as a variable and a and b as constants. It is the same idea in computer science.
	We may want to reference the value in x many times, and it might be easier to remember "x" than the value we are referencing, or we might want to alter that value in some way.
