notes for CSC 171 WS, Monday. Sept. 16, 2015

DISCLAIMER: 
This website is purely for archiving my experiences and notes with TAing for the class. 
These notes my not be particularly helpful to you. You should be able to get by in cs171 by just completing the homework assignments and studying programming. 
They might be useful as a reference or a way to familiarize yourself with cs terminology if you plan on continuing your studies in cs after 171.

what do computers understand?
	1s and 0s

	At the most basic level, a computer is a bunch of electricity running around turning things on and off. 
	But electricity is really really fast, so it does that very quickly. To represent things being on or off, 
	we choose to represent it as 0's and 1's. That way, it makes math much more reasonable for us to understand. 
	It's just a different number system! While you and I were raised to count to ten, computers only count to 2 (base-10 vs. base-2 number systems).

	Legendary hackers like Steve Wozniak, or the scientists who first created assemblers, were able to write programs which consisted of just strings of numbers, 
	because they knew which numbers corresponded to which CPU instructions. 
	Kind of like how a skilled musical composer could compose a complex piece of music by just jotting down the notes on a staff, without ever sitting down at a piano and playing a single note.
	That's how they wrote the first assemblers. On early "home computers" like the Altair, you would do this sort of thing - turn on the computer, 
	and the first thing you'd do is toggle a bunch of switches in a complex sequence to "write" a program.
	Once an assembler was written and could be saved on permanent storage (like a tape drive) to be loaded later, 
	you could use that assembler to write a better assembler, and eventually you'd use it to write a compiler, and use that compiler to write a better compiler.

what is computer science?
	the study of modeling problems in terms of what a computer can understand
	Computer Science is not just about building computers or writing computer programs!

what is an algorithm?
	a process or set of instructions (operations) to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

what is a program?
	A set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. How we write these instructions depends on the language we are writting in...
	over the years layers of abstraction have allowed us to write programs without ever having to deal with the underlying complexities of low level computation. 
	In other words, a computer program is often a specific implementation of a of an algorithm or set of algorithms. 
	An algorithm does not define the specific way it is to be implimented in conjunction with computer hardware. 

TERMS
primitives -  a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support. There also exist complex types which can be recursively constructed from basic primitives.
Examples of primitives are:
	numbers
	characters
	strings
	booleans

Variables
	a storage location paired with a symbolic name - not helpful
	basically, an abstract identifier which has a value. In simple algebraic equations of the form ax = b, we refer to x as a variable and a and b as constants. It is the same idea in computer science.
	We may want to reference the value in x many times, and it might be easier to remember "x" than the value we are referencing, or we might want to alter that value in some way.

Classes
	A template for creating objects. Individual objects are an 'instance' of the class and take on the attributes of the class as defined in the class's constructor.

Functions
	A function is a named procedure that executes individual instructions in some order. The language statement that requests the function is called a function call. 
	Functions can take arguments - real values passed into the function and return values.

Example relationship between objects

First program:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. // my first program in Java
2. public class HelloWorld {
3.     public static void main(String[] args) {
4.         System.out.println("Hello, World!");
5.     }
6. }
---------------------------------------------------------------
~Hello, World!
---------------------------------------------------------------
line 1: // my first program in Java
The two forward slash tokens indicate that the rest of the line is a comment inserted by the programmer but has no effect on the program itself. 
Comments are used to provide short explanations or observations concerning the code or program. There are many practices and styles for commenting. 
Some people utilize many comments, others prefer "self-commenting" code, and a few programmers - like Donald Knuth - follow the literate programming paradigm.

line 2: public class HelloWorld {

line 3: public static void main(String[] args) {
This line initiates the declaration of a function. Essentially, a function is a group of code statements which are given a name: in this case, this gives the name "main" to the group of code statements that follow. 
Functions will be discussed in detail in a later chapter, but essentially, their definition is introduced with a succession of a type (int), a name (main) and a pair of parentheses '()', optionally including parameters.

NOTE: The function named main is a special function in all Java programs; it is the function called when the program is run. 
The execution of all Java programs begins with the main function, regardless of where the function is actually located within the code.

line 6: System.out.println("Hello, World!");
This line is a Java statement. A statement is an expression that can actually produce some effect. It is the meat of a program, specifying its actual behavior. 
Statements are executed in the same order that they appear within a function's body.

This statement has two parts: First, System.out.println, which calls the println function in the System class with respect. Finally, a sentence within quotes ("Hello world!"), is the content passed into the println function.

Notice that the statement ends with a semicolon (;). This character marks the end of the statement, 
just as the period ends a sentence in English. All Java statements must end with a semicolon character. 
One of the most common syntax errors in Java is forgetting to end a statement with a semicolon.

WS 1 Problems:

Cup Problem
Goals:
Learn to convert real-world activities into instructions
Gain practice coding instructions with symbols
Gain understanding of the need for precision in coding
Gain practice debugging malfunctioning code
Spontaneously discover iteration and subroutines
Meet a computational hard problem and understand what that means

Exercise 1
Divide into groups of 2 or 3

demonstrate first 2 moves to simplest 3-cup stack program, then have group suggest a sequence WITHOUT cups, finally, execute it.
---------------------------------------------------------------
^ > > v < < ^ > > > > v < < < < ^ > > > v end
---------------------------------------------------------------

iteration: doing something repeatedly ie. >(5)

functions/subroutines: "mini-recipes within the program recipe" We provide a parameter for the subroutine to do its job. ie. ^>v< (x)

Tower of Hanoi 
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one cup can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper cup from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a cup can only be moved 
if it is the uppermost cup on a stack.
3. No cup may be placed on top of a smaller cup.

With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of 
Hanoi puzzle is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks...thus, this problem is an example of an "np-hard problem" 
as the solution to the problem scales in a non-polynomial fashion with respect to n - the problem size. 

Can you solve this problem for n = 4?
think about writing a general algorithm to solve this problem.

Recall:
	What is an Algorithm?
	What is a Variable?
	What is a Method?
	What is a Class?

Conditionals
control statement for executing a block of code depending on the evaluation of an expression as "True" or "False".

Iteration
Iteration in computing is the repetition of a block of statements within a computer program. It can be used 
both as a general term, synonymous with repetition, 
and to describe a specific form of repetition with a mutable state. Confusingly, it may also refer to any 
repetition stated using an explicit repetition structure, regardless of mutability.

For loops
control statement for iterating over a block of code finitely many times.

While loops
control statement for iterating over a block of code until some condition is met - may iterate infinitely many times.

Recursion
Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed 
to iteration). 
The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.
Many language support functions ability to call itself in the program code.

Structure and control flow of a simple program "int is_equal(n1, n2)" which returns true or false depending on the equivalency of two integers n1 and n2.

        |
        V   
     +--+--+   
     |Ret T|       
     +-----+ 
---------------------------------------------------------------
note about function returns:
The return statement of a function ends its execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.
If the method returns a void, it doesnt send back anything. For example, if I had a method p
that accepts an integer and then returns it, I could put int x = p(5); and x = 5. You are not restricted to 
numbers for return values. You can return strings as well. In the above example, I could just as easily return number representations of T/F: 1/0

WS 2 Problems:

Program design
Goals:
Gain practice designing the models (variables) used by the program
Gain practice structuring the control flow of an interactive program
Gain practice using expressions and conditionals to make decisions
Prepare for project 1

Exercise 1:
Design a game to play the "warmer/colder game"
the program must pick a random number and prompt the user for a guess. The program prints one of a range of responses in response to the guess - decrementing a score for each incorrect guess, and incrementing for each correct guess. The game loops until the user asks to quit or presses an "end" button.

Discussion:
Models, control flow, decision making, user interface, etc 

Programming Practice
Comfort in a programming environment comes through repetition and practice. These excercises will serve to (hopefully) make you more comfortable making short programs in java.

1. Write a simple java program to ask for your name, and print a personalized greeting.
2. Write a program to take 3 numbers and print them in ascending order. Use only the Math library.
3. A more advanced derivative of the above, write a program that takes two integers - temperature and wind velocity - and prints the "wind chill". You might find the Math.Pow() function useful here.
4. Discuss the three programming errors and why they occur. If you have forgotten, the three types of errors are Compiler errors, logic errors, and runtime errors.
5.* Write a program that takes a date and prints the day of the week it lies on
