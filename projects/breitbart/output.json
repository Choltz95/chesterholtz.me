And the question is why not?\u201d said Channel 2\u2019s veteran police reporter Moshe Nussbaum. \u201cMaybe, and I say this cautiously, but maybe he could have been stopped.\u201dJerusalem\u2019s police chief Yoram Halevy defended the police\u2019s inaction by saying only that they were monitoring \u201cmany potential attackers\u201d and the terrorist was \u201cone of those who certainly had the potential\u201d to carry out an attack.Halevy added that the attack could have been far worse were it not for heavy police presence in the area. The terrorist allegedly used an IDF issue M-16 machine-gun with \u201clots and lots of ammunition,\u201d he said, and had he made it to the center of town, \u201che would have killed lots of people.\u201dHowever, Ya\u2019ari maintained that the killer\u2019s rap sheet \u2013 including his renown as an inciter and the fact that he has been barred from the Temple Mount \u2013 should have kept the police on their toes. However, Israel\u2019s security apparatus, Ya\u2019ari said, did not think the terrorist was \u201cabout to make the transition from\u00a0using his fists to using a machine-gun.\u201dYnet news reported that blame for the attack also lay with Israel\u2019s justice system. The terrorist should have already been in jail, but in 2015 his sentence was postponed despite having repeatedly failed to show up in court.The terrorist told independent Palestinian news agency Ma\u2019an that he was intending to report to Ramle prison at 10am Sunday, the exact time he launched his killing spree.According to the report, failure to do so would mean facing imprisonment without trial.In the interview, the terrorist said he had been detained and released five times in the past two weeks, and was barred from entering east Jerusalem for a month.The attacker had been indicted on 15 counts of incitement to violence, and seven counts of supporting a terror organization, Channel 10 reported.Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan blamed social media sites like Facebook for not removing his posts, saying there was a direct link between the social media giant and terrorism.\u201cFacebook and other social media have a direct responsibility,\u201d Erdan said after touring the site of Sunday\u2019s attack. He added that it was \u201cscandalous\u201d that Facebook had restored numerous Hamas-linked Facebook pages in the past two weeks \u201cbecause of Palestinian public pressure.\u201dBig Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, glorifying terror, honoring martyrs, Israel police, Israel-Arab conflict, Jerusalem shooting attack, Justice System, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian Terrorism, TerroristsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Twelve minutes? Whatever it was, of discussion of this ridiculous tape.

Yes, of course it did. But the very people, including many, many Republicans, who got on their high horse, their self-righteous high horses about this, are the same guys who turn on pornography when they are traveling in Marriott hotels, and who often sleep with their secretaries on Capitol Hill, and do many more, worse things than Donald Trump has done in his life,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that Donald is pure as the driven snow. Donald himself would admit that he\u2019s far from pure as the driven snow \u2026 and quite frankly, even you and I right now are spending too much time on it,\u201d Klein told Marlow. \u201cWhat we saw last night was a huge, in my view, huge comeback by Donald Trump. Now, we\u2019ll see whether it\u2019s reflected in the polls. I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t think you and I can predict this. But certainly, he gave a masterful, masterful performance, and she was on her heels all night long.\u201dKlein thought Clinton\u2019s low-key performance during the second debate was interesting, given that she\u2019s spent \u201chundreds, if not thousands, of hours preparing for these debates, and is good at this kind of stuff \u2013 good at preparing, good at memorizing. She does her homework.\u201d\u201cBut, for whatever reasons, she was not ready for Donald last night,\u201d he judged. \u201cThere was this other thing that the New York Post captured on the front page of its paper today, which is his looming presence onstage while she was talking. He never sat down, as far as I can remember. He was pacing like a caged lion most of the time and while she was talking he was standing behind her, powerfully bigger and stronger than she, visually. I think that had an impact, too. It wasn\u2019t bullying. It wasn\u2019t like a man bullying a woman, quote-unquote. It was a simple visual of who has, as Pence would say, the broad shoulders, the power, the strength to lead this country, at a time when we need to shake things up, from the bottom up.\u201dKlein, having chronicled Bill Clinton\u2019s ongoing objectionable behavior in Guilty as Sin, was impressed by the sight of the women who accused him of harassment and assault sitting in the audience for the debate.\u201cI have a whole chapter on Bill Clinton\u2019s current \u2013 not back in the 1990s when he raped and harassed and intimidated women, not 20 or 30 years ago \u2013 we\u2019re talking about right now, Bill Clinton is continuing his exploitation of 20-year-old interns at his library in Little Rock,\u201d said Klein. \u201cI did not see one mainstream media outlet pick this up \u2013 or, for that matter, even check to see if I was accurate. Of course, I think I\u2019m accurate because I interviewed the girls who did the foot rubs, and I interviewed the man who was at his party when he hosed down the women in this wet T-shirt contest. But nobody in the media has bothered to check and find out what I did, by simply going down to Little Rock and asking questions.\u201d\u201cSo you can see this disgusting double standard that we are living with in this country, at a time when we can no longer afford to avoid truth,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe truth of the Islamicization of the Western world, our economy going down the tubes, our position in the world \u2013 look at what happened just yesterday. The Philippines, of all places, the president of the Philippines says he wants to get out of the American orbit and into the Chinese orbit. I mean, that is breathtaking\u00a0when you stop to think about it.\u201dKlein described a difference of opinion between himself and Trump on the issue of jailing Hillary Clinton: \u201cYes, she\u2019s guilty as sin. Yes, she deserved to be indicted. Yes, a grand jury should have been empaneled, and I thought she would have been found guilty and fined and maybe jailed, or at least fined at the very, very, very least, for jeopardizing national security \u2013 for going to Moscow and Beijing with her little Blackberry that was unsecure.\u201dHowever, he said he thought that if Trump were\u00a0elected President, \u201che\u2019s got a lot of important things to do, very important things to do, and he needs to get them done with the Congress,\u201d so appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton would \u201cbe a diversion from what is needed right now, which is to get the economy going again, lowering taxes, vetting immigration, as he says, building that wall, and bringing back America\u2019s leadership to the rest of the world.\u201d\u201cIf he gets sidetracked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s past, as egregious and terrible and dangerous as it was, I think that would be a mistake,\u201d Klein opined.When Marlow suggested that Trump might not really be looking to prosecute Clinton, but raised the possibility as a \u201cnegotiating tactic\u201d and an effort to \u201creset the conversation,\u201d Klein agreed that such an approach would be \u201cvery Trump-like\u201d \u2013 an example of \u201cgetting the best deal possible.\u201d\u201cGetting the best deal possible means having to work with your opponents, as well as your friends,\u201d Klein noted.He said Republicans who swiftly abandoned Trump after the tape of his 11-year-old vulgar comments surfaced \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\u201cI mean, they jumped off the bandwagon like a bunch of rats jumping off a sinking ship,\u201d said Klein. \u201cAnd now they look back over their shoulder and see that Donald not only won the debate last night, but in my view, at least to a certain degree \u2013 I don\u2019t know to what degree, we\u2019ll find out in the polls \u2013 reset the election. And here they are, all of them, you know, in opposition to their candidate. I think they look ridiculous. And there\u2019s nothing much they can do about it, at this point, I suppose. Donald has made them all look very foolish, and that\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201dBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.LISTEN:Big Government, Radio, 2016 presidential debates, Bill Clinton, Breitbart News Daily, Donald Trump, Ed Klein, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Heller was a reaffirmation that the Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment to protect a fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.Clinton\u2019s disagreement with the Heller decision runs so deep that she twice refused to admit the right to bear arms is constitutional during the June 5 airing of This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u00a0When Stephanopoulos first asked her if the right to bear arms is constitutional, she would only obfuscate, saying:I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment, until the decision by the late Justice [Antonin] Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities, and states, and the federal government had a right\u2013as we do with every amendment\u2013to impose reasonable regulations.Stephanopoulos followed up, pressing her to give a direct answer as to whether the right to bear arms is constitutional. Clinton said, \u201cIf it is a constitutional right, then it\u2013like every constitutional right\u2013is subject to reasonable regulation.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

According to my information, 40 to 50 percent of the force did not exist physically when we asked for help during operations,\u201d he explained. \u201cSalaries of ghost soldiers had been received during the past eight months and the money has gone to personal accounts.\u201dFurthermore, the governor of Helmand also noted that \u201cthere are ghost soldiers within the security forces in Helmand\u201d and that officials there have \u201cdiscovered at least 400 and scrapped them from the list.\u201dIn April 2015, SIGAR reported that Inaccurate and unreliable data on Afghan security personnel may place America\u2019s security and billions of U.S. taxpayer funds at risk, adding that the United States has spent nearly $70 billion to recruit, train, equip, house, feed, supply, and pay the salaries\u201d of the ANDSF, including those of \u201chollow\u201d Afghan brigades that do not really exist.The Pentagon refused to comment on whether the Obama administration is concerned about \u201cghost\u201d Afghan troops receiving U.S. taxpayer funds, jeopardizing U.S. gains, and placing American military troops at risk. It would not say whether any American troops have been killed our wounded after going into battle with nonexistent backing.The lives of U.S. and Afghan troops may be endangered when they are sent on missions with Afghan soldiers who turn out to be \u201cghosts.\u201dThe Associated Press (AP) noted earlier this year, \u201cThe heaviest cost of the ghost soldier phenomenon is being exacted on the battlefield.\u201dPresident Barack Obama has withdrawn the majority of U.S. military troops from Afghanistan, driving American troops to increase their reliance on their Afghan counterparts.For over a year, SIGAR has noted that the Obama administration is clueless about how many ANDSF troops \u201cactually exist.\u201dBig Government, National Security, Obama, Afghanistan, ghost troops, Helmand, SIGAR, U.S. Special General for Afghanistan ReconstructionComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The gift also funds new scholarships and professorships at the law school.Justice Elena Kagan, the newest member of the Court, spoke on behalf of the entire Court at the dedication ceremony, lauding her departed colleague as a \u201cremarkable judge and teacher.\u201dScalia \u201cwill go down in history as one of the most important Supreme Court justices ever, and one of the greatest,\u201d Kagan declared. \u201cHe did nothing less than transform our legal culture.\u201dThe five other justices of the High Court present for the ceremony were Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor.Kagan\u2019s participation was rich with symbolism in at least two regards. First, as an appointee of a liberal Democrat, Kagan\u2019s warm and generous praise highlighted the camaraderie of the justices and the status they aspire to as a nonpolitical branch of government.Second, like Scalia, Kagan was a prominent law professor before being appointed to the bench. In fact, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, the school where she earned her law degree and which was Scalia\u2019s alma mater, as well. (Scalia received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown.) So Kagan\u2019s approval carries with it the applause of academia, in recognition of Scalia\u2019s epic impact on legal philosophy.Scalia was a champion of originalism\u2013that in our democratic form of government, the Constitution requires that all laws (including the Constitution itself) must be interpreted according to the original public meaning of their\u00a0words, which would have been the meaning approved by the American people in adopting those words.Kagan knew Scalia before she\u00a0joined the Court from his trips to Harvard Law School during her tenure as dean. After Kagan\u2019s confirmation, Scalia became a close friend, taking her on hunting trips and other activities that were new experiences for Kagan. This outreach reflected Scalia\u2019s approach to life and the ease with which he made friends, also seen in his close friendship with archliberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who shared a love of opera with Scalia.University President Angel Cabrera and law school dean Henry Butler also participated in the naming ceremony.Antonin Scalia passed away in his sleep during the nighttime hours of February 12 this year.

But it also showed that Trump exceeded expectations, which impressed undecided voters.Frank Luntz\u2019s focus group of undecided voters on Fox News saw a massive shift away from Clinton and towards Trump, prompting him to declare: \u201cTonight was so significant that Trump is back in this race.\u201dPollsters and pundits debate whether presidential debates actually affect the outcome of elections. Republicans took heart in 2012 when challenger Mitt Romney handily defeated President Barack Obama in their first debate. But the Obama campaign\u2019s data mining team claimed to have the election in the bag already, and Romney\u2019s poor performance in the remaining debates may simply have sealed his defeat.Still, Trump\u2019s strong showing on Sunday left a far different impression than Romney\u2019s performance in the second debate in 2012, when he yielded to Obama and moderator Candy Crowley on the Benghazi issue.The Las Vegas debate will be the candidates\u2019 last chance to make a strong impression on voters on a national stage. Once again, Trump will likely enjoy the benefit of low expectations, since the media are determined to deny him an outright victory in the second contest.But Las Vegas is home turf for Trump, and a gambling city loves the underdog.

Once the baby died, though, Taylor\u2019s charges were upgraded to murder.Police reported finding bloody blankets and baby clothing in the laundry room and a later hospital examination not only revealed trauma caused by sexual assault but found bruises, cuts and massive bleeding on the child\u2019s head and face that was likely caused by repeated strikes.Jackson County Sheriff Tony Boggs said he was entirely shocked by the crime.\u201cI\u2019ve been here 25 years, and we\u2019ve never encountered something of this nature,\u201d Boggs exclaimed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve had anything like this near here.\u201dWest Virginia repealed its death penalty law in 1965, although there has been some recent interest in reviving the punishment.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Big Government, Obama, Pre-Viral, child abuse, Crime, Murder, sexual assaultComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.The pro-Western kingdom sealed its border with Syria in June, after a deadly cross-border attack claimed by Islamic State extremists killed seven members the Jordanian security forces. This has left more than 75,000 Syrians stuck between a war zone and a sealed border, without regular access to food, water and medicine.The displaced live in two makeshift tent camps in an area where the frontier is marked by two parallel low earthen walls, or berms. Conditions have become increasingly dire, with aid officials reporting the spread of disease, including whooping cough and hepatitis.Before the border closure, aid was sent from Jordanian soil. In August, Jordan permitted an aid drop by crane, in what was described at the time as a one-off shipment.U.N. agencies have since proposed setting up an aid distribution center between five and seven kilometers west of the largest encampment, known as Rukban, within the strip marked by the two berms, an aid official said. This would presumably have drawn the Syrians away from a Jordanian military base that is close to Rukban.However, Momani told The Associated Press on Monday that this is no longer being considered.\u201cThe new mechanism will be delivering aid on the berm through cranes, and the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,\u201d he said, adding it would be up to the aid agencies to decide on the pace of shipments.Momani said the border will remain sealed, citing an ongoing security threat to Jordan. The camps at the berm have been infiltrated by criminals, smugglers and extremists, he said.\u201cYou can describe part of it as a Daesh enclave,\u201d he said, referring to the extremist Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.The two aid officials said nothing has been agreed on. One of the officials, who has direct access to the talks, said he was not aware of an emerging agreement on crane drops. He said another meeting was set for Tuesday.The suffering at the berm has caused some friction between Jordan and the international community.Aid agencies have been pressing for a resumption of aid from the Jordanian side.Jordan has said the international community needs to take responsibility for those stranded at the berm, and that the kingdom has already done more than its share in taking in Syrian refugees. In the past, Jordan has argued that this aid needs to come from Syrian territory, not Jordan.Momani said Jordan has taken the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d by offering to help.Close to 5 million Syrians fled civil war in their country since 2011, including close to 660,000 who settled in Jordan.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Daesh, Islamic State, Jordan, Mohammed Momani, Rukban, Syria civil warComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In broad comparison with the wider Federal Government, the federal workforce dedicated to our national security and foreign policy is \u2013 on average \u2013 less diverse, including at the highest levels.While the administration said the lack of diversity does not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunities, the memo highlights actions that will facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse federal workforce.In a blog post that accompanied Obama\u2019s memorandum, national security adviser Susan Rice, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and\u00a0USAID Administrator Gayle Smith highlighted the need for the U.S. national security workforce to draw from the strength of America\u2019s diversity.\u201cNearly 40 percent of the approximately 320 million people in the United States are minorities, and an increasing number of them are earning college and graduate degrees,\u201d blogged Rice. \u201cAs America becomes more diverse, so do our best people. Yet, minorities make up less than 20 percent of our senior diplomats and 15 percent of senior military officers and senior intelligence officials.\u201dWhile President Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, attempted to make diversity a trademark of his tenure, black Americans and Hispanics experienced high unemployment rates during his presidency.Big Government, National Security, Obama, diversity, federal workforce, Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce, White HouseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was \u201chidden\u201d and \u201cdebatable.\u201d\u201cBy all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,\u201d said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts \u2013 which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn\u2019t be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy\u2019s office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a legislator, she didn\u2019t write the law, and she wasn\u2019t the president, so she didn\u2019t make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\u201dThat encomium hardly supports Clinton\u2019s claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband\u2019s White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe \u2013 fact-checking Clinton\u2019s claims during her primary run against Barack Obama \u2013 found that Clinton \u201chad little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.\u201dOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, \u201cI do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No \u2013 Teddy does, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d (\u201cTeddy\u201d is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, CHIP, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform.

If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know.

For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would \u201cnever, ever happen,\u201d but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn\u2019t wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: \u201cI want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act.

Some examples:\u201cIf you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don\u2019t have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.\u201d (June 2013)\u201cSo we\u2019re in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you\u2019re going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what\u2019s succeeding, fix what isn\u2019t, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.\u201d (January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would \u201cnever, ever happen,\u201d but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn\u2019t wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: \u201cI want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t want it repealed, I don\u2019t want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don\u2019t want us to end up in gridlock. People can\u2019t wait! People who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\u201dDuring Clinton\u2019s primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was \u201cin favor of what\u2019s called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age.\u201d Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care\u2026 and described it as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201dby Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.\u00a0According to FBI Director James Comey, \u201cthe FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not among the group of 30,000 e-mails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.\u201d\u00a0Federal investigators concluded\u00a0that Clinton\u2019s lawyers deleted nearly half of the 60,000 emails on her server.\u00a0by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF TRUETrump was answering a question about Islamophobia, and while he acknowledged that prejudice against Muslims is a problem, he argued that political correctness places American lives at risk.\u00a0\u00a0He cited the neighbors of the San Bernardino terrorists \u2014 and he was correct to do so, because they did tell reporters after the attack that they had seen unusual activity, but chose not to report it for fear of being accused of racial profiling.However, the neighbors did not actually see \u201cbombs\u201d (though that was, in fact, what the San Bernardino terrorists were building in their home).So while Trump\u2019s statement about political correctness was essentially true, he was incorrect about the details.by Katie McHugh9 Oct 2016Clinton stated during the debate:\u201cI will not let anyone into the country that I think will poses a risk to us, but there are a lot\u00a0 refugees, women and children\u2026 There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe because of Russian aggression, and we need to do our part. We are by no means carrying anywhere near the load Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be, from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\u201dFact-Check: FALSE (According to Clinton herself)\u00a0The Wikileaks dump revealed that Clinton herself said refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, as Breitbart News reported:\u00a0Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton\u2019s 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that \u201cvigilant\u201d screening and \u201cvetting\u201d of \u201crefugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,\u201d will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from \u201cjihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton\u2019s speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago\u2019s Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches reads as follows:\u201cSo I think you\u2019re right to have gone to the places that you visited because there\u2019s a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it\u2019s on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can\u2019t possibly vet all those refugees so they don\u2019t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cTurkey for the same reason.\u201d\u00a0In September, a top Obama immigration official also admitted to Congress that some refugees launch terrorist plots after they\u2019ve been \u201cvetted\u201d and invited into the United States.\u00a0by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUEThis is an extremely difficult statement to fact-check, because a great deal depends on what is meant by \u201creforming the tax code.\u201d A thorough rundown of Clinton\u2019s voting records on tax issues prepared by Forbes in April 2015 reveals little in Senator Clinton\u2019s record that could be fairly described as a significant reform.In summary, Clinton voted against the Bush tax cuts, but voted for a few amendments to the bill that did not pass; she eventually voted yes to extend those tax cuts, while complaining that she thought they benefited the wealthy too much. She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform. At the end of her term, she tried to raise the top marginal tax rate back to its pre-Bush level, which is hardly a \u201creform\u201d of the system.by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhile\u00a0one video\u00a0published by the Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a\u00a0\u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda \u2013 the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters.Much of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of\u00a0jihad (\u201choly war\u201d) and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as\u00a0hadiths. At one time,\u00a0half\u00a0of the propaganda the group published sold potential recruits on constructing a jihadist utopia in Syria and Iraq. Much of the\u00a0media\u00a0that does not touch on the benefits of living in a society cleansed of infidels instead depicts\u00a0graphic executions, including some\u00a0performed by children,\u00a0intended to intimidate the Western world.One exception is a video in which an image of Bill Clinton captioned \u201cfornicator\u201d is used as a rallying cry to destroy America, \u201ca secular state built on man-made laws whose soldiers fight for the interests of legislators, liars, fornicators, corporations, and for the freedom of Sodomites.\u201dThe rise\u00a0of\u00a0groups like the Islamic State \u2013 formerly Al Qaeda in Iraq \u2013 has been fueled significantly\u00a0by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy since 2008. The\u00a0Obama White House\u2019s approach\u00a0to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly \u2013 not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like\u00a0Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was\u00a0critical\u00a0in implementing these policies.by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF FALSEIt is true that the Birther movement started among Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters. And, as Breitbart News reported, Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, admitted that at least one member of the campaign had helped propagate the rumor (though she said that person was fired.) It is also likely true that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal shopped the story to reporters. And it is unknown how much involvement Hillary Clinton herself had with the movement.However, it is a stretch to say, as Trump did, that Hillary Clinton herself personally started the Breitbart movement, and it is incorrect to claim that her campaign manager corroborated that particular accusation.(The real truth about the Birther rumor, which the mainstream media choose to ignore, may be that Barack Obama started it himself by allowing his literary agent to claim, for nearly two decades, that he was born in Kenya.)by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEThe\u00a0New York Times\u00a0obtained Trump\u2019s tax returns which revealed that the Republican nominee\u00a0avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting losses on his 1995 tax return.Clinton criticized Trump\u00a0as the hypocritical embodiment of\u00a0\u201cthe same rigged system he claims he will change.\u201dHowever, Clinton herself has taken advantage of the same tax loopholes she\u2019s hammered Trump over.\u00a0According to Clinton\u2019s\u00a02015 tax returns,\u00a0she reported capital gains losses to lessen her tax burden through a \u201ccarryover.\u201dOn page 17, \u201cCapital Gains and Losses\u201d for \u201cWilliam J Clinton\u00a0&\u00a0Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Clintons reported a \u201clong-term capital loss carryover\u201d of $699,540. In other words,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0reported a \u201cnet long-term capital gain or (loss)\u201d of negative \u201c$699,540.\u201dDuring Sunday\u2019s debate clinton also falsely stated that Trump is \u201csomebody who maybe hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in 20 years.\u201d\u00a0That statement is also false.\u00a0The\u00a0Times\u00a0admits that Trump\u2019s\u00a0tax statements reveal that he may have\u00a0avoided paying income taxes for \u201cup to 18 years.\u201cby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016\u201cThey had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,\u201d Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.\u00a0\u201cYou were there as Secretary of State with the so-called \u2018line in the sand.'\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, I was gone,\u201d Clinton replied.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEPresident Obama delivered his famous \u201cred line\u201d speech \u2013 in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a \u201cred line\u201d that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences \u2013\u00a0in August 2012.\u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,\u201d President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State\u00a0from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013,\u00a0according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad\u00a0used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.\u00a0Assad was most recently accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo in\u00a0September 2016. He remains dictator of Syria after \u201cwinning\u201d an election in 2014.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEClinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was \u201chidden\u201d and \u201cdebatable.\u201d\u201cBy all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,\u201d said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts \u2013 which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn\u2019t be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy\u2019s office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a legislator, she didn\u2019t write the law, and she wasn\u2019t the president, so she didn\u2019t make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\u201dThat encomium hardly supports Clinton\u2019s claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband\u2019s White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe \u2013 fact-checking Clinton\u2019s claims during her primary run against Barack Obama \u2013 found that Clinton \u201chad little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.\u201dOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, \u201cI do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No \u2013 Teddy does, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d (\u201cTeddy\u201d is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSEClinton never apologized for the statement, despite what her running mate and other surrogates have claimed.\u00a0Here is her full statement\u00a0after her remarks emerged in the media.

If he had said America was currently experiencing one of its slowest growth periods since 1929, he would have been entirely correct, but there have been a few slower periods \u2013 and, of course, a few outright recessions, or negative growth \u2013 since then.It would be playing word games to argue that the recessions shouldn\u2019t be counted, because they weren\u2019t economic growth. Even so, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.It has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama\u2019s is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that\u2019s not what Trump said.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEDuring a\u00a0March 13,\u00a0CNN Town Hall\u00a0in Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201dClinton\u00a0continued to explain\u00a0that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don\u2019t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.\u201dOhio, a key battleground state,\u00a0was the\u00a0ninth largest coal producing state\u00a0in 2013.\u00a0by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEResponding to an audience question asking what he would do to diminish \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d Trump noted that the United States has been targeted on multiple occasions in the past year by \u201cradical Islamic terrorists. \u201cAnd she,\u201d referring to Clinton, \u201cwon\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t use the term, \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,'\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, to solve the problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.

We\u2019re going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\u201cShe,\u201d of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton\u2019s plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is \u201cdown to 1 percent.\u201d In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump\u2019s statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump\u2019s assessment of the U.S. as having \u201cjust about the highest\u201d taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying \u201cjust about.\u201d More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he\u2019s talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates \u2013 America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world \u2013 currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico\u2019s unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America\u2019s top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America\u2019s were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUE.According to\u00a0the\u00a0the Urban Institute, which examined the\u00a0average Obamacare premium increases from 2015 to 2016, American consumers can expect\u00a0to see major spikes in their healthcare costs.Those people in Oklahoma, who bought their own low-cost exchange insurance plan, have seen their premiums rise\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0from 2015 to 2016.

We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengageing [sic] the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.The Intercept reports that the memo discussed how to generate positive press for Clinton\u2019s decision making. The site found two articles by Haberman that did the job: here and here.In the first article, Haberman describes touts Clinton\u2019s decision to hire a research team to unearth\u00a0negative items about her \u2014 a process called \u201cself-vetting.\u201d Her insider account bore the title\u00a0\u201cHillary Clinton Begins Process of Vetting \u2014 Herself\u201d:The scope of the firm\u2019s work is unclear. But self-research is considered critical in campaigns. And in the six years since Mrs. Clinton was last a candidate, she has created a paper trail of paid speeches, charitable donations and diplomatic decisions as secretary of state.For months, Democrats not aligned with Mrs. Clinton had privately wondered whether she had started the process of assessing the scope of existing documents, information and other potential material her rivals could use against her. Some expressed concern that she was beginning this self-scrubbing process relatively late, and might not leave herself enough time to learn about her own potential vulnerabilities to be able to respond effectively.In the second article, \u201cHillary Clinton Aides Are in Talks to Fill Top Campaign Roles,\u201d Haberman shows the care and concern Clinton had building her team:The prospects are mostly people who have worked with Mrs. Clinton before, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about personnel discussions.The conversations reflect a fast-moving effort by Mrs. Clinton to build a campaign as a number of Democratic Party operatives are vying for position. While the budding campaign had been criticized as too white and too male in its early stages, this group of operatives is diverse and would give Mrs. Clinton a number of women and people of color in top jobs.Greenwald and\u00a0Fang wrote that they gave both the Clinton campaign and Haberman 24 hours to contest the veracity of the documents.

McCabe9 Oct 2016Washington, D.C.0Raddatz, Breitbart News has learned, refused to publish a story on the alleged improper collusion and coordination between then Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) and the national headquarters of the\u00a0Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, also known as ACORN\u2014despite having enough evidence to do so.Raddatz, along with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, will co-moderate this upcoming Sunday evening\u2019s presidential debate between GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton.After she and her producer received a tip about ACORN corruption\u2014and Obama\u2019s connection to it\u2014and evidence backing up the eventual whistleblower\u2019s claims, they showed initial interest in pursuing the story. Anita Moncrief, the eventual ACORN whistleblower told Breitbart News exclusively that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Avni Patel in 2008.Both Patel and Raddatz were given documents that they covered up and refused to report on until after the election. Raddatz, who was then the White House correspondent for ABC News, and her producer Patel were also provided with personal accounts of the collusion between ACORN and the Obama campaign in October 2008, Moncrief told Breitbart News.Moncrief, who worked in ACORN\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters, would later expose the organization when she turned into a full-blown whistleblower after the election. But if Raddatz ran the story, the election may have turned out differently, especially had the public known the depths to which this scandal went.Moncrief told Breitbart News that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Patel in Washington after initially having made contact with Raddatz herself through a representative. The meeting lasted almost an hour in a coffee shop in Washington, D.C.After meeting with Patel, Moncrief received an email from the producer:Anita,\nIt was good talking to you today. I look forward to learning more, and\u00a0taking a look at those documents you mentioned. It sounds like the\u00a0easiest way to get those from you would be to directly download the\u00a0files from your web-transfer site. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can try\u00a0to\u00a0send them to my gmail account.Patel gave Moncrief every indication that ABC News was going to broadcast the report, she said.\u201cThey were very excited. They said they were willing to run the story,\u201d she said.Using the user name and password given to her by Patel, Moncrief sent documents on Oct. 14, 2008 to Patel using the company\u2019s file transfer protocol line, ftp1.abc.com.\u00a0There was another transfer of another dozen documents by email to Patel on Oct. 26, 2008.Moncrief told Breitbart News that ABC News received and acknowledged receipt of the documents that spelled out specific instances of collusion between the Obama campaign and named individuals at ACORN and Project Vote.\u00a0Among the documents were internal correspondences with Moncrief\u2019s name, which she said she included to prove that she was who she said she was.Moncrief told Breitbart News the Obama campaign passed to ACORN and by extension to its sister entity Project Vote the campaign\u2019s full donor list, which included all donors and fuller descriptions. This list was different from the limited list of contributors the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission, which for example did not include small-dollar donors.\u00a0Because of their non-profit status, ACORN and Project Vote were prohibited from coordinating with a candidate\u2019s committee.ACORN and Project Vote also received the full donor lists from the 2004 presidential campaign of then Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA), she said.Soon after Moncrief left ACORN, she contacted the New York Times and its reporter Stephanie Strom about the cooperation she witnessed. Strom and Moncrief worked together from July 2008 to October 2008.But, by September, Moncrief said she was frustrated with Strom\u2019s articles that were based on her information about ACORN and Project Vote, but failed to describe the cooperation.\u00a0Moncrief said Strom told her that her editors were watering down the stories after they were submitted.Attorney and columnist Michael Gaynor\u00a0told Breitbart News that over the summer of 2008, he became an adviser to Moncrief and her effort to expose ACORN-Obama corruption.In September 2008, Moncrief told him that she was beginning to think that the Times was just stringing her along, he said. \u201c\u2018I need a Plan B\u2019 she told me.\u201dGaynor calls himself a conservative Catholic and he said he immediately suggested EWTV, radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News.The problem was that Moncrief was a left-wing activist and she wanted to go through a left-leaning media outlet, so he suggested ABC News and Martha Raddatz, he said.Gaynor said he met Raddatz through email because he she sent him proof that he had repeated a false claim about her suppressing the number of soldiers in Iraq supporting Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) for president.With that awkwardness between them, Gaynor said he reached out to Raddatz and explained to her the whole story of collusion between ACORN and Project Vote and the Obama campaign. After the initial conversation, Raddatz told Gaynor that she was interested.\u00a0Moncrief said she then emailed Raddatz and attached her resume, so that Raddatz would appreciate her background. Raddatz emailed back and told her that Patel would would follow up.Raddatz has a troubled history of undisclosed associations with Democrats that arguably affect her ability to be impartial.She\u00a0was the moderator for the 2012 vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and now House Speaker\u2014then GOP vice presidential nominee\u2014Paul Ryan. But Raddatz did not disclose to viewers that Biden\u2019s running mate, President Barack Obama, attended her 1991 wedding\u2014when she married now former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Julius Genachowski.The position of FCC chairman is a presidentially-appointed slot, which means Obama,\u00a0after attending her wedding to Genachowski,\u00a0appointed her by-then ex-husband to one of the most senior positions in the federal government. Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997.\u00a0Genachowski, a long-time friend of the president\u2019s, also attended Obama\u2019s 1992 wedding,\u00a0when he married First Lady Michelle Obama.At a public event in 2013, after Obama and Biden won reelection, Breitbart News confronted Raddatz about her failure to disclose the significant conflict of interest to the general public before moderating that debate.At the National Press Club event, Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle asked Raddatz:\u201cDo you think\u2014there was obviously a little bit of a kerfuffle ahead of the vice presidential debate about the fact that the president attended your wedding to the FCC chairman. Do you think that that was handled right and given a second chance would you have done it a little differently?\u201dRaddatz responded:\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to handle that. It was\u2014and I\u2019m really not going to comment about that. That was something that happened two days before the debate. It had been in The New York Times quite a while before that, I believe. I just got to put this out of my head. That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing.\u201dThis revelation about ABC News covering up the ACORN story before the 2008 election is also not the first time that network\u2014which is influenced heavily by former Bill Clinton White House staffer and ABC This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2014covered up a damning story about a Democrat right before an election.In fact, right before the 2012 election, ABC News among other outlets had been provided with intricate details about the scandal that has since, years later, led to the indictment of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). They had a chance to break part of the scandal, and chose to not print allegations from prostitutes in the Dominican Republic that Menendez had underpaid them for sex.They also had evidence of other parts of the Menendez scandal, particularly connections to Democratic Party mega-donor Dr. Salomon Melgen\u2014who\u2019s also been indicted on the corruption charges\u2014that the network decided against running.When Raddatz had Menendez on her program after the election with the scandal dominating national news,\u00a0she conveniently forgot to ask him about it, as Breitbart News reported at the time.Shortly thereafter, ABC News attempted to undermine the accounts of several of the prostitutes\u2014but after Menendez was indicted, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed the prostitution allegations against Menendez were in fact supported by \u201ccorroborating evidence.\u201dEven BuzzFeed News admitted\u00a0Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle\u2014who originally reported the prostitution story while at The Daily Caller\u2014was correct on the story.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Acorn, barack obama, Bob Menendez, debate, Donald Trump, FCC, martha raddatzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Breitbart News article written two years ago in October states, \u201c[W]hat is even more appalling is that, so far, the site has gone largely unpunished by law enforcement for their facilitation of this despicable criminal activity. The \u2018adult\u2019 section of the site has become a horrific hub for the sex trafficking industry as women and children are being illegally sold for sex through classified ads posted to their page.\u201dThe bust by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was the largest human trafficking bust in the Lone Star State\u2019s history, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\u00a0Almost 35 members of the Texas AG\u2019s Law Enforcement Unit participated in the arrest of Backpage\u2019s CEO. They also executed a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of the business at 2501 Oak Lawn Avenue. A search reveals that Ferrer is no longer in the Harris County, Texas jail. The Sacramento Bee reports that he is in a Sacramento jail and is being held without bail.Backpage is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States.\u00a0Backpage.com\u00a0has its principal place of business in Dallas but it is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation (LLC).The website operates a worldwide online classified advertising site. Among other ads, people can post or locate adult escort advertisement services.\u00a0An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by Breitbart Texas stated, \u201cIt is currently the single largest purveyor of Internet sex ads in the United States, and\u00a0Backpage.com\u2019s profits from this line of business register in the millions yearly.\u201dThe Texas and California attorneys general worked together on a lengthy investigation and found evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the website a \u201cdeep-seated evil\u201d and \u201cmodern-day slavery.\u201d He explained that the victims that are sex trafficked include both voluntary and involuntary participants and minors.The probable cause stated within the affidavit for a search warrant stated included that Backpage.com\u00a0receives more than 90% of their revenues from adult escort ads. Just in California, those revenues for January 2013 to May 31, 2015 was $50 million, or between $1.5 to $2.5 million per month. It stated that Ferrer has been the CEO of the website since 2012 but has handled the day-to-day operations for the company for a much longer period. All business and financial records of shareholders Ferrer, Jim Larkin and Michael Lacey were targeted in the affidavit for search warrant.It also said that \u201cFerrer\u2019s communications and emails obtained by search warrant, his interactions with law enforcement, and even the public statements of his high level executives, such as his General Counsel, reflect personal knowledge that\u00a0Backpage.com derives support or maintenance from the earnings of people engaged in prostitution.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s Pimping statute provides that it is a criminal offense \u201cknowing another person is a prostitute,\u201d to \u201clive, derive support or maintenance from the earnings or proceeds of a person\u2019s prostitution,\u201d or to \u201csolicit or receive compensation for soliciting for the person.\u201d Ferrer faces a sentence from between three to eight years of imprisonment under the California felony pimping statute.In Texas, Ferrer also faces money laundering charges. Pimping qualifies as a \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under the Texas Penal Code section for money laundering because it is an offense \u201cpunishable by confinement for more than one year under the laws of another state.\u201d The credit cards, gift cards, debit cards, Bitcoin, and cash used to purchase ads for prostitution on Backpage.com all qualify as \u201cfunds\u201d under the Texas Penal Code.\u00a0Under the Texas Money Laundering statute, the court can consider all $50 million generated by the websites\u2019s adult escort section in California when classifying this offense because it constitutes an ongoing business model and a continuing course of conduct, says the affidavit. \u201cIf proceeds of criminal activity are related to one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources, the conduct may be considered as one offense and the value of the proceeds aggregated in determining the classification of the offense.\u201dAn offense in Texas for money laundering is a felony of the first degree if the value of the funds is $300,000 or more. Conviction would be punishable in prison time from five to 99 years up to life, and a fine of up to $10,000.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

If they can\u2019t find workers, then they can\u2019t produce, and we\u2019ll end up importing.Ryan even converted his 2013 argument about a labor shortage into an argument for cheap labor forever instead of labor-saving, productivity boosting machinery.The flip side of\u00a0the\u00a0argument\u00a0is:\u00a0Just\u00a0raise wages enough to attract people. But you raise wages too much in certain industries, then you\u2019ll get rid of those industries, and we\u2019ll just have to import.\u201dDairy-milking machines are used at up to 70 percent of farms in some parts of Europe \u2014 but are only used in a few percent of U.S. farms, said Justin Segner, a Wisconsin-based salesman for a European robot-maker, Lely. \u201cThis is in its infancy in the United States,\u201d he said, partly because the federal government imposes stringent food-safety regulations on the cow-milking machines, and also because federal policy favors the use of migrant laborers, he said.Segner told Breitbart News that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Paul Ryan, adding he plans to invite Ryan to see the cow-milking machines in operation.Lely\u2019s cow-milking machines are assembled by American workers in\u00a0Pella, Iowa.Ryan\u2019s\u00a0suggestion\u00a0that\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0shortage\u00a0of\u00a0high-skilled tech workers is a favorite talking point\u00a0amongst business interests and Silicon Valley executives, who stand to profit from an influx\u00a0of wage-cutting foreign workers. However, it is a talking\u00a0point\u00a0that tech\u00a0labor market experts have\u00a0thoroughly\u00a0debunked.\u00a0U.S. Census data shows there are more than 11 million Americans with degrees with\u00a0Science, Technology \u00a0Engineering and Math (STEM) who lack e employment in these fields. In fact, U.S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in their professions.That sympathy for employers\u2019 demand for cheap labor is part of Ryan\u2019s long-standing libertarian worldview. For decades, he\u2019s and other GOP leaders have believed that companies should be able to hire foreign workers when they\u2019re not pleased with supply of American workers. This \u201cany willing worker\u201d view would condemn Americans and their grandchildren to an economy where salaries can\u2019t rise above the poverty wages that are acceptable to the next African or Asian willing to fly into the country.Ryan also justifies his support for migration by saying migrants are needed to fund retirement for a growing number of retired Americans:Boomers are retiring, we\u2019re going to need medical professions. We\u2019re going to need nurses and doctors \u2026 even if we get everybody off of welfare into work \u2026 we\u2019re still going to have population needs because of demographics in this country. [We\u2019re facing] a 90 percent increase in the retirement population but only a 19 percent increase in the [working] population. So we are going to need people, we are going to need legal immigrants. That means in my mind, visas ought to be given based upon your contribution to society, your skill set that is needed in our economy that cannot, is not being filled by Americans.Ryan\u2019s focus on migrants is misguided, says Steve Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. Even the current flood of immigrants is making make very little difference to the number of workers, and the migrants nudge up the birth rate by only about 4 percent, he said. Moreover, immigrants get older, they retire and they consume a huge amount of taxpayers funds that could otherwise preserve Americans\u2019 retirement programs, he said.\u201cThe thing about immigrants is that they tend to be much poorer than natives \u2026 you can\u2019t pay for the retirement programs with a lot of immigrants who consume a lot of entitlement programs, such as welfare,\u201d he said.Moreover, there\u2019s no shortage of working-age Americans, Camarota said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s\u00a0problem is that we don\u2019t have enough people of working age \u2014 our problem is that so many people of working age don\u2019t work.\u201dThe better fix, he said, is to increase the productivity of working Americans via better education, business practices and technology. \u201cProductivity is obviously the ultimate solution\u201d to the retirement problem, he said.\u00a0In fact, Segner told Breitbart News that older farmers in Wisconsin are postponing their retirement because their robots are taking over the never-ending task of milking the cows, two or three times a day,\u00a0365 days a year.The fixation on cheap imported labor that is shared by Ryan and the business-backed wing of the GOP explains why\u00a0Donald Trump won the 2016 nominee.Trump got the nomination because because he says the immigration system should be tuned to help Americans before it help business executives, Wall Street stockholders, or foreigners.\u00a0That\u2019s the fundamental difference why Ryan\u2019s allies \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 were cheerfully kicked to the curb during the 2016 GOP primary by Trump\u2019s supporters.In a recent Arizona speech,\u00a0Trump\u00a0promised to enact \u201cnew immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first,\u201d and to keep \u201cimmigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms.\u201d In the vice-presidential debate,\u00a0Gov. Mike Pence said the\u00a0immigration issue \u201creally does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.\u201dRyan is gradually learning from Trump\u2019s success.\u00a0In his interview with Ryan, Brownstein insisted that polls show that most GOP supporters support amnesty, and then suggested Ryan should push GOP legislators to award \u201clegal status\u201d to the 11 million-plus cheap-labor illegal immigrants in the United States.But\u00a0Ryan actually waived away Brownstein\u2019s immigrants-before-Americans agenda.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to start with security,\u201d Ryan replied.The problem so many people have is there\u2019s no faith or confidence we\u2019ll actually secure our borders, that will actually have interior security, so the feeling is that we will do something on the legal side [to help business] but we won\u2019t secure our border and that we\u2019ll have the same problem 10 years down the road.Brownstein pressed for a \u201cpackage\u201d mass-amnesty bill that is favored by his advertisers, by business groups and by Democrats, but Ryan didn\u2019t budge.\u00a0What I don\u2019t think works is a big comprehensive bill. Those always collapse under their own weight. i think it\u2019s the wrong way to go. I think you stage reforms and \u00a0they must begin with a confidence-building exercise that is critical for national security\u2026 \u00a0\u2014 [s0] secure the border, [do] interior reinforcement\u2026In the day and age of heroin coming into our high schools and ISIS trying to penetrate southern border, you have got to deal with this \u2026 if we deal with that in a way that gives people the sense that we are actually securing our country, then I think attitudes will change across the country where people then are willing to embrace fixing our broken immigration system.That new emphasis on proven border security before eventual amnesty is a big change for Ryan.For decades, he\u2019s sided with business interests which have worked with Democratic legislators to flood the country with tens of millions of lower-wage, lower-skilled, government-dependent immigrants. Ryan did nothing while those migrants pushed up to\u00a0seven million blue-collar and white-collar working-age American men out of the job market \u2014 but now he\u2019s reacting after seeing how GOP voters repaid the favor by pushing his immigration-touting GOP peers out of the primary race.But Ryan still hasn\u2019t accepted the reality that his party\u2019s \u00a0base \u2014 plus many independents and Democrats \u2014 really don\u2019t want to be treated just as replaceable workers in an elite-run world economy.Each year, 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and begin entering the workforce. But, each year, the federal government also imports 2 million foreign workers \u2014 legal immigrants, guest-workers, refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants \u2014 to compete for jobs against Americans.\u00a0The inflow of\u00a0professionals and blue-collar workers drives down the salaries of American white-collar and blue-collar workers while boosting income for investors and employers.\u00a0The inflow also crowds the schools used by the children of lower-income Americans, sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants, reduces innovation and productivity, pushes many lower-skilled Americans out of the workforce, and enables\u00a0large-scale violence by immigrant communities against Americans who do not live in protected neighborhoods.Polls show that Americans don\u2019t want to compete for jobs against cheap-labor immigrants, illegal or legal, and they don\u2019t want to see their children forced into low-wage jobs alongside clannish groups of foreign-language migrants. Americans want to be nice to immigrants \u2014 but almost 90 percent says companies should hire Americans before importing more workers.\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration, Paul RyanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Williams, Ph.D.9 Oct 20160In all, the Pope named 17 new cardinals, including 13 who are under 80 years old and therefore eligible to participate in the conclave electing the next pope.Notably, in his selection for cardinals from among the United States bishops, Francis named the recently appointed archbishop of Chicago, Blaise Cupich, a man with impeccable liberal credentials. He also broke with protocol by choosing Archbishop William Tobin of Indianapolis, a relatively small archdiocese never before considered important enough to have a cardinal at its helm.On the other hand, the Pope passed over the conservative archbishops of Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles\u2014Charles Chaput, Allen Vigneron and Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez, respectively\u2014despite the fact that their three important archdioceses have in recent memory always been considered \u201ccardinalatial sees.\u201dArchbishop Chaput was responsible for bringing Pope Francis to the United States in September 2015, hosting the pontiff for the World Meeting of Families.Veteran Vatican analyst John Allen noted that with his new appointments, Pope Francis had engineered a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in the Catholic hierarchy in the United States, and by naming just progressives, \u201cFrancis was making a statement about the direction in which he wants the American church to go.\u201dThe Pope\u2019s picks also underscore the very real divisions within the U.S. Catholic bishops conference.A year ago, Archbishops Cupich and Chaput faced off over a theologically indefensible op-ed published by the Chicago Archbishop that suggested that abortion was no more important than a number of other social justice issues such as unemployment, immigration and capital punishment.In a signed\u00a0essay\u00a0in the Chicago Tribune, Archbishop Cupich listed a series of social ills that he said people should find \u201cjust as appalling\u201d as the gruesome ripping apart of unborn children and the sale of their organs by Planned Parenthood.While applauding the strong reaction to the Planned Parenthood videos, Cupich immediately added: \u201cWe should be no less appalled by the indifference toward the thousands of people who die daily for lack of decent medical care; who are denied rights by a broken immigration system and by racism; who suffer in hunger, joblessness and want; who pay the price of violence in gun-saturated neighborhoods; or who are executed by the state in the name of justice.\u201dA week later, Archbishop Chaput responded with a sharp rebuke to Cupich in his own diocesan newspaper, Catholic Philly. In his article, bearing the pithy title \u201cThere is no equivalence,\u201d Chaput stated: \u201cThe deliberate killing of innocent life is a uniquely wicked act. No amount of contextualizing or deflecting our attention to other issues can obscure that.\u201dThis was not the first time that Archbishop Cupich has \u201ccontextualized\u201d the evil of abortion.A regular contributor to the Jesuit magazine\u00a0America, in 2008, Cupich wrote a piece against\u00a0racism,\u00a0just prior to the presidential election that saw Barack Obama elected president. In it, he suggested that voting on the basis of race is morally equivalent to voting for a pro-abortion candidate.For his part, Indianapolis Archbishop William Tobin has also been critical of America\u2019s culture wars, and publicly clashed with Republic vice presidential nominee Mike Pence over the idea of welcoming Syrian refugees into the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.Sunday\u2019s nominations represent an important step in Francis\u2019s project of shifting emphases within Church, as well as his move toward more global representation among the college of cardinals. The bulk of the new cardinals come from outside Europe, hailing from Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania.The sole Italian elector the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Syria, Archbishop Mario Zenari.The ceremony for the creation of the new cardinals will be held on November 19, at the conclusion of the Jubilee Year of Mercy.Follow Thomas D.

If we open it up to anybody and everybody, all sorts of people will come out of woodwork. Anti-immigrant, anti-anything. They suggest that the forum be invite only but make it as wide as possible. Work with faith leaders, United Way, etc\u2026 Perhaps, we could go back to the Congregational Church and continue the conversation there.The mayor and resettlement organizations shrouded the plan in such secrecy that not even the town\u2019s aldermen were informed of what was taking place behind closed doors. The aldermen eventually wrote to the U.S. Department of State protesting the plan and opened an investigation into the mayor\u2019s actions. The State Department has not yet ruled on whether it will resettle refugees in Rutland despite the aldermen\u2019s protest.The Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program is the local affiliate of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (U.S.C.R.I) , one of the nine national voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) who receive more than $1 billion annually in federal funding to resettle refugees across the country.As Breitbart News reported previously, the Chief Executive Officer of U.S.C.R.I, Lavinia Limon, was the director of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement during the Bill Clinton administration. She is one of the architects of the policy that rejects traditional American assimilation of refugees\u00a0and immigrants\u00a0into the country and promotes, instead, \u201can aggressive multi-culturalism\u201d described as \u201cintegration\u201d by proponents, but known as \u201cbalkanization\u201d or \u201cdisintegration\u201d by critics.During FY 2016, the Obama administration resettled more than 12,500 Syrian refugees in the United States, out of a total of 84,995 resettled refugees.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has said she wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees coming in to the United States to 65,000 annually. Donald Trump, in contrast, is \u201ccommitted to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.\u201dThe Obama administration has proposed increasing the total number of refugees allowed into the United States in FY 2017 to 110,000. During the first six days of October 2016, the beginning of FY 2017, the Obama administration brought in more than 3,000 refugees, an annualized rate of 185,000 refugees.As Judicial Watch reports, the concealment efforts runs deep in Rutland, Vermont:Handwritten notes state that the issue was, \u201cNot what can \u2018we\u2019 do for \u2018them,\u2019 but what the diversity, cultural richness do for the community.\u201d The documents contain detailed discussions of what Rutland will need to provide for the refugees \u2013 including housing, jobs, medical care, and places for worship.Judicial Watch received the documents in response to a Vermont Public Records Law request to the office of Mayor Christopher Louras.Merdzanovic later told the Boston Globe that the hidden talks were \u201cthe right thing to do \u2014 to move slowly, keep it to a small circle of people, and then expand.\u201dOn April 10, 2016, she wrote to the director of the State Refugee Office about her coordination with the mayor to keep the resettlement program secret:He did share with me that the Governor\u2019s office called him after getting a frantic call from DOL [Vermont Department of Labor] inquiring about the plan to resettle \u2018100 Syrians in the next month\u2019 in Rutland. Again, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of not sharing the information even if it is confidentially. Please respect our process, you will have plenty of opportunity to share and take action once we have met with the stakeholders. At that point we can and will share it widely. It will not serve any one of us well if the community in Rutland learned about it through the grapevine and not directly from us. The above example shows that what people hear and how they interpret it is two different things.\u201cLocal opponents of the refugee plans wanted a public vote on the proposal and transparency on the refugee settlement plan,\u201d Judicial Watch notes.\u201cAmericans should be concerned that the Obama administration is funneling at least $46 million in tax dollars to a shady operation that encourages elected officials to cover up Obama\u2019s Syrian refugee scheme,\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said on Friday.Missoula, Montana is another small community that offers an additional recent example of this pattern of secrecy.\u201cMissoula could resettle up to 150 refugees of as many as 15 nationalities in the next 12 months, but the biggest numbers will reflect the world\u2019s most troubled spots,\u201d\u00a0Refugee Resettlement Watch\u2019s Corcoran writes.\u201cI visited Missoula on my [Refugee Resettlement Watch] \u00a0fact-finding trip this summer and learned that the contractor office was being kept secret,\u201d she adds.A similar story of secrecy surrounds the proposed placement of 100 Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Flint, Michigan in FY 2017.\u201cCity leaders have not been informed of the details involving this matter,\u201d a spokesperson for the mayor of Flint, Michigan told Breitbart News last month.Big Government, Immigration, Ann Corcoran, flint michigan, Judicial Watch, Lavinia Limon, Missoula Montana, Office of Refugee Resettlement, refugee resettlement, Refugee Resettlement Watch, Rutland Vermont, Rutland Vermont Mayor Christopher Louras, Syrian refugees, Tom Fitton, U.

More than\u00a068,000 fraud complaints have been filed in the region in the region from at least 40 disasters since 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina.Green said that over 50,000 of those complaints have been referred to local authorities and law enforcement agencies.Scammers following disasters usually come in the form of federal emergency aid and phony contractors who are looking to scam homeowners.Green told the media that fraudsters are already defrauding residents who have seen disaster during Hurricane Matthew. He said they have already received one call coming in about a scam.This is not the first case where Louisiana flood victims have seen more than just flood disaster, but also a blackout of media coverage, obliviousness from politicians and a lack of monetary help from donors.As Breitbart Texas reported, donations for Louisiana\u2019s 2016 flood victims have been far less compared to the donations that came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been largely criticized for their slow response and lack of help to Louisiana flood victims, as Breitbart Texas reported.Almost a month after the storm touched down in the region, FEMA had only set up one \u201cmanufactured housing unit\u201d in the area, despite more than 100,000 damaged homes and 60,000 homes fully destroyed.Two weeks after the storm, more than 1,400 residents remained in shelters, as a large number of homeowners did not carry flood insurance because the region had never flooded in the past.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Pollak9 Oct 20160The Democratic presidential nominee is exploiting\u00a0a video from 2005 that surfaced Friday, showing her Republican rival, Donald Trump, joking about groping women.Trump, while apologizing, has pointed to Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior towards women in the Oval Office and throughout his career \u2014 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in enabling it.Though Trump is not running against Bill, his defenders have focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s treatment of\u00a0the many women who accused her husband of impropriety and even assault \u2014 including Monica Lewinsky, Juanita Broaddrick, and others.The\u00a0Washington Post recently recalled the pattern of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defenses of her husband against what she called \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d:\u2026 Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers \u201csome failed cabaret singer who doesn\u2019t even have much of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to fall back on.\u201d She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, \u201cI mean, I would crucify her.\u201dThe\u00a0Post\u00a0noted: \u201cSix years later, Bill Clinton acknowledged a sexual encounter with Flowers.\u201dIt added that when the Lewinsky scandal emerged, in which Clinton had oral sex with the then-White House intern in the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton refused to credit the story of his accuser, choosing to believe her husband\u2019s lies instead. She reportedly called Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony toon.\u201dFormer Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, now an anchor for ABC News, wrote in his memoir All Too Human: A Political Education\u00a0that Hillary Clinton had to \u201csavage her enemies\u201d during the Lewinsky affair, repeating a pattern from previous scandals involving her husband\u2019s behavior towards women.In 1991, for example, when a woman named Connie Hamzy emerged to accuse Bill Clinton of having an affair with her, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cWe have to destroy her story,\u201d according to Stephanopoulos. He then set about arranging affidavits from people who could back up Bill Clinton\u2019s story: \u201cWe\u2019d survived our first bimbo eruption,\u201d Stephanopoulos recalled.Later, Stephanopoulos wrote, he wondered whether he had been \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior \u201cbecause my defense of Clinton against past bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn\u2019t create new ones.\u201dThe same might be said of Hillary Clinton.Joel B.

There are only perfect leaders in Hollywood.\u201dBrot added that both Republicans and Democrats had not necessarily wanted both candidates as their first choice but despite this \u201cthe parties are standing behind them.\u201dA Facebook page for Republicans Abroad Israel called on supporters to stick by Trump.\u201cWhen your team is under attack, you RALLY AROUND THE FLAG, YOU DON\u2019T BURN IT AND RUN,\u201d one posting read.Zell, an international lawyer based in Jerusalem, did not support Trump early in the campaign but later changed his mind. Zell maintains that among the reasons for his change of heart was witnessing Trump\u2019s staggering success in the primaries \u2013 winning 37 states to beat out 16 other candidates in the race.\u201cFirst and foremost, the people have spoken, and they have spoken in an unequivocal fashion,\u201d the Washington DC native told the\u00a0Times of Israel in August.Zell also praised the Republican platform for dropping the notion of the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d as an answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201cI\u2019m against unrealistic policies. I am against trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. There\u2019s no context in which a two-state solution in today\u2019s world would work.\u201dHe said the GOP nominee also deserved accolades for bringing topics that have been taboo in previous elections to the fore \u2013 NATO, immigration and American trade agreements to name a few.\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who, just by the unorthodox manner of campaigning, introduced these topics into public debate. That\u2019s fantastic. This shows already his ability to influence public opinion and to change the order of things,\u201d he said.Zell, who is a Princeton graduate, praised Trump\u2019s ability to detect the electorate\u2019s ire over the current political establishment, the report said.\u201cHe understood this, either instinctively or deliberately, and he tapped into that groundswell of discontent and rode it to (nomination) victory,\u201d he said.\u201cThe system needs to be shaken up, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, chief rabbi, Clinton, democrats, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Israel, Israel Republicans Abroad, Jerusalem, lewd comments, Marc Zell, Trump, Trump Campaign, White House, womenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Security Council (UNSC), considered the most powerful body of the alliance, decided to ignore the growing tensions between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.The decision comes after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concerns over the significant increase in tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of recent developments in Kashmir, particularly military clashes between the two countries along the border that separates their respective Kashmir regions in violation of the 2003 ceasefire.\u201cHe calls on the Governments of Pakistan and India to address their outstanding issues, including regarding Kashmir, peacefully through diplomacy and dialogue. His good offices are available, if accepted by both sides,\u201d said a spokesman for Ban in a statement issued Sept. 30.That same day, Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan\u2019s UN ambassador, pleaded with U.N. secretary-general \u00a0to intervene in what she referred to as a \u201cdangerous\u201d situation between the two nuclear-armed rivals.\u201cThis is a dangerous moment for the region,\u201d Lodhi said after meeting with Ban at UN headquarters in New York. \u201cThe time has come for bold intervention by him if we are to avoid a crisis, because we can see a crisis building up.\u201dThe U.N. chief has reportedly offered to mediate efforts to defuse escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.On Tuesday, day after the Russian-led U.N. Security Council said it was planning to address the India-Pakistan confrontations over Kashmir, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said the commissioner, \u201cis seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, as well as the rising tensions between India and Pakistan.\u201dIn public, India and Pakistan have expressed a willingness to defuse the rising tensions. However, both countries accuse one another of provocations that have led to ceasefire violations. They both appear to have preconditions for peace.While India has long accused Pakistan for providing military assistance and training to rebels and even some terrorists fighting in Kashmir for independence from India or to merge the region with Pakistan, Islamabad has accused India of cracking down on dissent among the Muslim-majority population of Kashmir seeking independence from India or a merger with Pakistan.About a year ago, Islamabad also accused India of backing terrorist groups, namely the Pakistani Taliban known as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, reported The Hindu.Meanwhile, India has accused Pakistan of backing terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).New Delhi blames Islamabad for helping LeT foment unrest in Kashmir.Big Government, Jihad, National Security, India, Kashmir, Lashkar-e-Taiba, LeT, Pakistan, Pakistani Taliban, Russia, Tehrik-e-Taliban, TTP, United Nations, united statesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The company will redeploy some assets from its DHL Express operations to establish a parcels network in the two countries next year, she said.She said similar initiatives using existing assets would take precedence over big acquisitions.\u201cWe feel the house is the way we want it to be,\u201d she said, adding that further deals would add \u201ca nice piece of furniture\u201d.The growing popularity of internet shopping was driving demand for its parcels services, she said.In Germany, where it had 44 percent of the market in 2015, the group is expecting a record Christmas. \u201cWe have on average 4 million parcels a day (\u2026) we expect in the pre-Christmas peak to go up to 8 million parcels,\u201d she said.BREXIT OPPORTUNITYKreis said she was personally sad about Brexit, but the group had traded through many political and financial upheavals in the more than 220 countries where it operates and it would take Brexit in its stride.\u201cThe big noticeable thing at this point is the devaluation in the pound, but in terms of real underlying trading we don\u2019t see any deterioration in growth rates,\u201d she said.Brexit could be an opportunity, she said.\u201cWe are also very experienced in dealing with situations where there are trade regulations and complex customs regimes, that to a certain degree is something we sell to our customers,\u201d she said. \u201cComplex customs regulations are something where you as a logistics company can show your strength.\u201dIn terms of Deutsche Post\u2019s financial strategy, Kreis said the message was one of continuity.She wants to maintain the group\u2019s triple B plus credit rating, keep to its guidance of paying 40-60 percent of net profit as dividends, and redistribute excess liquidity to shareholders or use it to fund pensions.After a year beset by strikes, the company, which provides one in 200 German jobs, is rebuilding its profits. It has forecast operating profit this year of between 3.4 billion and 3.7 billion euros, up from 2.41 billion in 2015.(1 euro = 0.9008 pounds)Big Government, Breitbart London, National Security, Brexit, Deutsche Post DHL, European Union, Global tradeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

(Since dropped by the media in order to help Hillary avoid the subject.)(4) He is corrupt.(5) He is a bad businessman.(6) He is not a Republican. (Also since dropped \u2014 Hillary\u2019s losing enough Democrats to Trump without reminding them that he\u2019s not a \u201creal Republican.\u201d)(7) His \u201ctone.\u201dAll that\u2019s already been priced into the Trump brand. What new results do the media expect from telling us that Trump not only insulted Rosie O\u2019Donnell, but also insulted Hispanic Mattress Girl, Alicia Machado: baby mama to a Mexican drug lord?The only advance in the narrative is that the octaves of journalists\u2019 voices keep getting higher, as they repeat the exact same attacks on Trump.Each time, the media claim victory by asserting with bland certainty that any drop in Trump\u2019s poll numbers is because of something very upsetting to journalists, but which is generally quite popular with voters \u2014 the Mexican rapists speech, the Muslim ban, and his response to the choleric Muslim, Khizr Khan.The media can tell us where the candidates stand in the polls. They can\u2019t tell us why. Nonetheless, they insist on identifying the precise statement of Trump\u2019s that has caused any setback, which always happens to be whatever the media is being hysterical about.Most absurd was the widely repeated claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cinsult\u201d of GOLD STAR DAD Khizr Khan caused him to dip in the polls. Except the problem is: (1) He didn\u2019t insult Khan; and (2) anyone who occasionally leaves his apartment realizes that no one would have minded if he had.Khan\u2019s son was one of 14 Muslims to die serving in the U.S. military, which, coincidentally, is the precise number of American soldiers who have been killed\u00a0by\u00a0Muslims serving in the U.S. Military.At the Democratic Convention, Khan waved a copy of the Constitution, asking Trump, \u201cHave you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words, \u2018the right of all Muslims in the world to move to America shall not be abridged!\u2019\u201dActually, that\u2019s not in the Constitution. Incomprehensibly, Khan told Trump to look for the words \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cequal protection of law\u201d \u2014 words that are noticeable for not mentioning \u201cthe right of all Muslims in the world to move to America.\u201dHe rounded out his harangue saying to Trump: \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one!\u201dIn an article titled \u201cIre for Trump as He Derides Muslim Parents,\u201d The New York Times described Trump\u2019s response to Khan as \u201cstartling,\u201d and said it \u201cdrew quick and widespread condemnation.\u201d This included a tweet from Bush speechwriter Peter Wehner, calling Trump \u201ca man of sadistic cruelty. With him there\u2019s no bottom. Now go ahead and defend him.\u201dI must have accidentally been out of the country for a few days because I missed the part where Trump insulted the Khans.But according to the Times, Trump was \u201cderid(ing)\u201d the Khans when he went on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and called the snarling Muslim a \u201cnice guy,\u201d wished him luck, wondered why his wife didn\u2019t say anything, and talked about the reasons Americans might want to hit the pause button on mass Muslim immigration.To wit, Trump said:\u201cWell, I would say, we have had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that\u2019s what I\u2019d say. We have had a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things. You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris, where his throat was cut, 85-year-old, beloved Catholic priest. You look at what happened in Nice, France, a couple of weeks ago. I would say, you gotta take a look at that, because something is going on, and it\u2019s not good.\u201dI understand why the media are upset that Trump mentioned these notable contributions of Muslim immigrants, but unless I don\u2019t know the country at all anymore, I do not believe a majority of Americans minded one bit.The media are betting that after 9/11, the diaper bomber, the shoe bomber, the Boston Marathon, Fort Hood, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, the Orlando nightclub, the Chelsea bombing, and the recent mall attacks in both Minnesota and Washington, the revulsion of the American public to anti-Muslim bigotry will be a HUGE factor in this election.Journalists swim in a sea of agreement. They don\u2019t stop to think that the identity politics they majored in back in college might not be popular with all Americans.Polls showed a post-convention bounce for Hillary before Trump had said word one about Khan. Perhaps their nonsense headlines about Trump attacking a GOLD STAR FAMILY also helped them in the short run.But as soon as the public found out that it was this specific family and, also, that Trump didn\u2019t attack them, voters weren\u2019t mad at Trump, but they sure were with the media.COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER\u00a0\nDISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Alicia Machado, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, Khizr KhanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Times\u00a0and\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0were contacted by Peck, in an email chain reminiscent of GameJournoPros and JournoList.Peck, who has previously labelled Wintrich\u2019s pro-Trump photography as \u201cneofascist,\u201d\u00a0urged her peers to ignore the Trump-supporting artist\u2019s\u00a0upcoming event, which will feature art submissions from Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, and Martin Shkreli.In an email to the chain, Peck suggested that journalists should ignore the \u201calt-right clowns\u201d and their art show.From: Jamie Peck <jamie.e.peck@gmail.com>\nDate: Tuesday, October 4, 2016\nSubject: i know you\u2019re smartHi everyone-Sorry to revive this CC nightmare (minus anyone claiming to be Martin Shkreli) but the topic is relevant and I don\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire by writing about it publicly.Some alt-right clowns (Shkreli included) are having an art show in New York this weekend in the hopes of causing a media circus.\nhttp://www.papermag.com/pro-trump-art-show-williamsburg-brooklyn-2029015793.html\nHow about we make like we did with this email chain and ignore it until it goes away?\nHave a sparklingTuesday. :)The\u00a0email went out to more than three hundred journalists from a range of British and American publications, including\u00a0TIME,\u00a0Vice, The New York Times, New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The New York Post, The L.A. Times, L.A Mag, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror\u00a0The Huffington Post, Mic.com, BuzzFeed, Deadspin, Business Insider, The Verge, TechCrunch, The Daily Dot, Gadgette, and Tech Insider.Broadcast journalists were also present on the list, which included reporters, directors, and managers from MSNBC, CNBC, BBC, CNN, and ESPN.One employee of the Associated Press, a strategy manager, was also present on the list.Breitbart\u00a0contacted all journalists on the email chain, including Peck, to confirm the authenticity of the email and to gauge their opinion on the ethics of attempts to coordinate coverage across multiple journalistic outlets.Most journalists on the email chain did not reply to our request for comment, but there were a few exceptions. When asked to confirm the authenticity of the email,\u00a0Colin Pinkham, a contributor to Jezebel, Wonkette, Uproxx and Fusion told us this:I can confirm that id rather shove a red hot cactus up my ass than ever say anything that might in any way benefit the douchehats at Breitbart.Dell Cameron, a reporter for the Daily Dot, got back to us with a similar, though less graphic reply.I can confirm that\u00a01.609 is a good number to multiply mileage by if you\u2019re trying to figure out approximately how many kilometers you\u2019ve driven.Miles Klee, an editor at the Daily Dot, was more detailed in his flippancy.That email did indeed come from Jamie Peck, and everyone on the resulting thread\u2014several hundred editors and writers in all\u2014agreed not to cover the art show in question. Furthermore, some of us have decided to go to the art show anyway (in secret, of course) and fart on the art. I am one of these volunteers, but my conscience is beginning to gnaw at me. Is this ethical? Will it even accomplish anything? I am adrift and looking for any answers. Thank you for exposing this nefarious plot, and godspeed.Eventually, serious replies began to trickle in. One journalist, who wanted his name and publication kept off the record, confirmed that the he \u201cdid get the email\u201d and that \u201cit comes from an email address I believe to be Peck.\u201dAnother journalist, from a mainstream web publication, confirmed that they also received the email, although they were slightly baffled as to why. \u201cYeah it\u2019s real.\u00a0We all received it. I don\u2019t know why the fuck I\u2019m on that thread and I don\u2019t why the fuck people keep emailing it. But I did. It\u2019s real.\u201dTed\u00a0Scheinman, an editor for the\u00a0Pacific Standard,\u00a0also confirmed that he believed the email to be from Peck, although he argued that because the email chain emerged out of happenstance, there was nothing nefarious about it or Peck\u2019s use of it.Oh yes, I assumed the email was legitimate, though I myself don\u2019t know Jamie Peck \u2013 \u2013 one of the many odd things about this list is that it includes a seemingly random group of web and magazine writers, many (or most?) of whom didn\u2019t know each other before the original email, and who also (I think) work on vastly different beats from one another. Some aren\u2019t journalists at all.\u201dI didn\u2019t in the least read Peck\u2019s email as pressuring collusion, still less as the start of some dark coordinated effort. Remember that this isn\u2019t a curated list of likeminded journalists; it\u2019s an assortment of people brought together purely because one of these guys (Shkreli) spammed us a handful of times in a bid for press and general attention. (I suspect he would say it was merely to ruin our day, or something.)So the list began as this weird random web thing and continued in that vein \u2013 \u2013 hardly a secret group of journalist co-conspirators. Christ, there\u2019s at least one sex worker on the email list; she wrote in and made it clear that she had no desire to be counted among journalists. I liked that response a lot.According to our information, no journalist on the list has responded to Peck\u2019s request with support or disavowal, which makes it difficult to tell who among them are following her lead on the\u00a0proposed blackout. Judging by the responses of the Daily Dot and Jezebel contributors however, there\u2019s no shortage of anti-conservative sentiment among the journalists on the list.What we do know is that no publication named on the list has covered Wintrich\u2019s upcoming event, which is politically newsworthy and features a number of high-profile figures from media and business.A comprehensive list of the publications contacted by Peck is copied below. We will not reveal the names or email addresses of the individual journalists contacted at this time.At the time of writing, none of the contacted publications have covered Wintrich\u2019s art show.Disclosure: This author has previouly contributed an article to TechCrunch, which is one of the publications named in this\u00a0list.Correction: Mic.com did cover a story related to Lucian Wintrich\u2019s art exhibition, about a planned fundraiser for LGBT veterans.\u00a0You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.Big Journalism, Milo, Tech, Alt Right, Death And Taxes, Jamie Peck, Lucian Wintrich, Martin Shkreli, Milo YiannopoulosComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

(The Republican National Committee counted 57 interruptions.)But Conway, speaking to Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly in the spin room after the debate, highlighted Kaine\u2019s interruptions of CBS News\u2019 Elaine Quijano.Kelly was skeptical, but Conway defended her point, noting that she was just holding Kaine to the Clinton\u00a0campaign\u2019s own standard:Conway: There he was, interrupting a female moderator. We lost track of the times. We\u00a0just stopped writing it down. He was interrupting \u2014Kelly: You can interrupt a female moderator, same as a male.Conway: Well, no. It\u2019s the Clinton campaign who loves to throw around words like \u201csexism\u201d and \u201cunhinged.\u201d They\u2019ve got to be regretting those words on a night like tonight, when Tim Kaine looked like both.Later in the interview, Kelly asked Conway about Trump\u2019s low approval ratings with women in some polls. Conway reiterated her\u00a0view that Kaine had damaged himself, and the Clinton campaign: \u201cYou think that Tim Kaine\u2019s performance tonight is going to\u00a0sit well with women?\u201dShe added: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to hear from all the pundits tonight, \u201cthese vice-presidential debates don\u2019t really matter, they won\u2019t move the polls,\u2019 because they know how lopsided a victory it was for Mike Pence.\u201dUpdate: Later, Conway reiterated the point in an interview with Sean Hannity, noting that if Donald Trump or Mike Pence had treated a female moderator the way Tim Kaine had, it would have been a scandal.Joel B.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Those doubts are twofold: first, about her decision to choose\u00a0so weak a candidate, who seemed unable to answer basic policy questions; and second, about Clinton\u2019s\u00a0health, since if her medical troubles are as bad as feared, Kaine may be taking over\u00a0at some point if she is elected.Kaine could not stop interrupting Pence, at times sounding high-pitched and shrill, at times whining and\u00a0defensive. Pence was cool and even-tempered \u2014 presidential, in other words, while Kaine seemed to be playing\u00a0cable news pundit.The Democrat was often\u00a0unable to suppress the juvenile impulse to shout campaign talking points, even in the middle of his opponent\u2019s answers. At one point, he interjected: \u201cOur plan is like Ronald Reagan\u2019s plan from 1986.\u201d (Note to Democrats: the Reagan plan failed.)Later, when the moderator asked why Putin would respect a Trump-Pence administration, Pence answered: \u201cStrength.\u201d Kaine, unable to restrain himself, blurted out: \u201cBusiness deals.\u201d His smirk\u00a0betrayed his conviction that he had just scored points, even though the moderator had to instruct him \u2014 for the third time, at least \u2014 to wait until it was his turn to speak.Kaine seemed not to understand how un-serious\u00a0he looked. Pence responded with a steady, and appropriate, put-down: \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201dPence also beat Kaine over the head with the Russian \u201creset,\u201d Clinton\u2019s email scandal, and the Clinton Foundation. Moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News stepped in to protect Kaine, especially when it came to the email scandal (though, to her credit, she at least asked about it, unlike NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt in the first presidential debate).There was nothing in Tim Kaine\u2019s performance that showed he could act like a president.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Columnist Charles M. Blow led\u00a0with that inflammatory accusation on Monday\u2019s opinion page:Donald Trump is a domestic terrorist; only his form of terror doesn\u2019t boil down to blowing things up. He\u2019s the 70-year-old toddler who knows nearly nothing, hurls insults, has simplistic solutions for complex problems and is quick to throw a tantrum. Also, in case you didn\u2019t know it, this toddler is mean to girls and is a bit of a bigot.Blow did not define what he meant by \u201cterrorist.\u201dThe episode recalls one in 2011, when columnist Joe Nocera called the Tea Party movement \u201cterrorists\u201d:You know what they say: Never negotiate with terrorists. It only encourages them.These last few months, much of the country has watched in horror as the Tea Party Republicans have waged jihad on the American people. Their intransigent demands for deep spending cuts, coupled with their almost gleeful willingness to destroy one of America\u2019s most invaluable assets, its full faith and credit, were incredibly irresponsible. But they didn\u2019t care. Their goal, they believed, was worth blowing up the country for, if that\u2019s what it took.The\u00a0Times editorial page appears to be holding a name-calling competition. Tuesday\u2019s paper featured Roger Cohen opening in a similar style to Blow, albeit with a slightly less inflammatory epithet:Donald Trump is a thug. He\u2019s a thug who talks gibberish, and lies, and cheats, and has issues, to put it mildly, with women. He\u2019s lazy and limited and he has an attention span of a nanosecond.

Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: TRUE.Not only did foreign governments and foreign donors give to the Clinton\u2019s family charity, but the majority of people outside of the government who met with Clinton while she was in office were Clinton Foundation donors, according to the Associated Press.The ultimate proof of Pence\u2019s claim? The Clinton Foundation has grudgingly said that it would no longer accept foreign contributions if she became president.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, former President Clinton\u2019s exact words on Monday were as follows:So you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.CNN reports Clinton realized his mistake and tried to walk his comments back the following day:Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake. We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people. But there is a group of people \u2014 mostly small business owners and employees \u2014 who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can\u2019t get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they\u2019re not in big pools, so they have no bargaining power.by Katie McHugh4 Oct 2016In his June 16, 2015 speech announcing his run for the presidency, Donald Trump said the following: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they\u2019re killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems.Thank you. It\u2019s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people.It\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\u2019s coming probably\u2014 probably\u2014 from the Middle East. But we don\u2019t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop and it\u2019s got to stop fast.Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U.S.-Mexico border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it\u2019s common for human traffickers to \u201cto sexually assault or rape the females\u201d en route to the U.S., and the smugglers \u201cusually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree\u2014a rape tree.\u201d Furthermore, it is true that as the U.S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47,000 people in 2014 alone, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the heroin consumed in the U.S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation. \u00a0UPDATE: Later in\u00a0Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate, while trying to attack Trump\u2019s detailed immigration policy proposals, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine again claimed that Donald Trump and Mike Pence said \u201call Mexicans are bad.\u201d\u00a0Fact Check: FALSE. These words have never been uttered by either the Republican presidential nominee or vice presidential nominee. Again, Trump specifically criticized the rampant criminal activities committed by illegal aliens coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, many of whom are Mexican nationals.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.The stop-and-frisk policy dates back to a 1968 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed police to stop and frisk in individual based on a reasonable suspicion that he or she is armed and dangerous and may be involved in a crime. The policy has been constitutional for nearly four decades. During that time, and especially during the last two decades (until the last two years), relationships between police and communities have improved.\u00a0After Bill de Blasio became mayor of New York in 2014, that city dropped stop-and-frisk. That coincided with a precipitous decline in the relationship between police and communities. If stop-and-frisk were the cause of the friction, ending that policy would have resulted in better and more harmonious relationships. Stop-and-frisk has nothing to do with the present controversy.by Frances Martel4 Oct 2016\u201cDid you know Iran\u00a0was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?\u201d Kaine asked, adding later, \u201cUnder Secretary Clinton\u2019s leadership\u2026 [the United States] worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.\u201dThere is no evidence that the Islamic Republic of Iran has abandoned its nuclear ambitions, and subsequent revelations of secret \u201cside deals\u201d as part of the greater JCPoA exposed the fact that Iran may be able to double its uranium enrichment capacity after a decade.The Iranian nuclear deal was\u00a0signed in July\u00a02015. A year later, the Associated Press\u00a0published the provisions\u00a0hidden in a document not publicly available previously, which elucidated what would happen to the Iranian nuclear program\u00a0after the first ten years of the agreement\u2019s implementation. According to that document, Iran will be allowed to begin \u201creplacing its mainstay centrifuges with thousands of advanced machines.\u201d While it will ultimately possess fewer centrifuges to enrich uranium with, these machines will be so efficient, the AP notes, that \u201cthey will allow Iran to enrich at more than twice the rate it is doing now.\u201dA report\u00a0released this September by the\u00a0Institute for Science and International Security found that the deal will also allow, through an exemption, Iran to keep 50 tons of\u00a0heavy water\u00a0and \u201ccontinue operating 19 \u2018hot cell\u2019 radiation containment chambers.\u201dPossessing materials such as enriched uranium and heavy water does not necessarily mean Iran will have the capacity to restore its nuclear program. The deal will\u00a0not allow nuclear inspectors to confirm, however, whether or not Iran is complying with the deal. Iran got negotiators to agree that no U.S. nuclear inspectors will be allowed on Iranian soil.Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has done little to calm those alarmed by the possibility of Iran having access to advance uranium enrichment technology. Shortly after the signing of the deal, he published a book titled\u00a0Palestine, in which he argues that Iran has a role to play in the destruction of Israel, and so must work to create and possess the strongest weapons possible.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In May, Trump said he thought minimum wage levels should be left to the states, and offered the opinion that the current minimum wage sounds too low for workers to make a decent living. Later, in August, he expressed support for raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour, but still preferred to let state governments handle the issue.\u201cI have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other,\u201d Trump said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 8, 2016.Asked by NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd if he thought the federal government should set a minimum wage floor, Trump replied:No, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what\u2019s happened to the economy, with what\u2019s happened to the cost. I mean, it\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.In August, Trump told Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News that he still does not believe there \u201chas to be\u201d a federal minimum wage, but added, \u201cI would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. I know it\u2019s not very Republican to say.\u201dWhen O\u2019Reilly proposed a $10 minimum wage, Trump replied, \u201cI would say 10. I would say 10. But with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs. I don\u2019t want people to be in that $10 category for very long. But the thing is, Bill, let the states make the deal.\u201dTrump has maintained this position in several subsequent comments: he believes the minimum wage should be raised to $10, but the states should do it, not the federal government.by AWR Hawkins4 Oct 2016He used the example of the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack to make his point. During that attack a gunman walked into gun-free zones on the Virginia Tech campus, shooting and killing 32 innocents. What Kaine failed to mention is that the Virginia Tech gunman passed a background check for his firearm.\u00a0And the Virginia Tech gunman is not an anomaly among mass public attackers, Breitbart News previously reported that the vast majority of public attackers\u2013and alleged attackers\u2013of recent memory all acquired their guns via background checks. These include:In addition to these examples, Paris, France, has extremely comprehensive background checks\u2013even more comprehensive than those in California\u2013yet they also suffered 12 shot and killed during the January 7, 2015, Charlie Hebdo attack and lost another 130 innocents killed during a November 13, 2015, firearm-based terror attack in the city.The bottom line: Kaine\u2019s statement that background checks \u201cmake us safer\u201d is only true if you dismiss all the instances in which they haven\u2019t.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.Donald Trump has never made the U.S. alliance with Israel conditional. Period. That part of the statement \u2014 \u201cONLY work together with Israel if\u2026\u201d \u2014 is 100% false.As for the phrase \u201cbig league,\u201d Trump did use those words \u2014 but not specifically in relation to Israel. He was talking, in general, about countries that America defends.\u00a0Israel is not one of them: the U.S. provides money for Israeli defense, but does not defend Israel directly.\u00a0Here is Trump\u2019s exact quote, as reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:At a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Monday, the Republican presidential front-runner was asked whether he believed the Israeli government should pay for American defense, as he had called for other U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to do.\u201cI think Israel will do that also, yeah, I think Israel do \u2014 there are many countries that can pay and they can pay big league,\u201d Trump responded.\u201dLater that day, Trump gave a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual policy conference.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, as CNN Money noted in a July profile of Pence, he was a \u201cleading fiscal conservative\u201d during his 12 years in Congress, and \u201cbacked various efforts to reform Social Security in a bid to make the program solvent for the long term and to reduce government spending.\u201d As CNN Money noted, one of those reform plans was proposed by President George W. Bush. Pence and other conservatives had \u201cpreviously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush\u2019s \u2013 one that would have phased in faster and let workers put more of their payroll taxes into private accounts.\u201dIt is a common liberal caricature of these proposals to claim they would have wiped out Social Security, but this is merely hysterical rhetoric, of the sort deployed against all serious reform efforts. Allowing workers the option to put some of their money into private accounts would not have \u201crepealed\u201d or \u201cdestroyed\u201d Social Security; those who proposed such reforms were explicitly attempting to save the system, which is unquestionably heading for insolvency, according to the Social Security trustees themselves.CNN Money also recalled Pence stating that cuts to Social Security payments, or increases to the retirement age, were \u201con the table\u201d in 2010. \u201cI think everything has to be on the table. I\u2019m an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu,\u201d Pence declared.Most politicians, including most Democrats, make similar statements about looking at all options to keep Social Security solvent for as long as possible. President Barack Obama proposed cuts to Social Security benefits in his budget for fiscal 2015, for example. Raising the retirement age is frequently discussed as a way to keep the system running as the U.S. population ages, although the idea is always controversial. As for Donald Trump, he has said, \u201cI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cas our demography changes, a prudent administration would begin to examine what changes might be necessary for future generations.\u201dby Frances Martel4 Oct 2016\u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because\u00a0Bin Laden is dead,\u201d Kaine argued, receiving the question to answer before rival Mike Pence. \u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because the Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped,\u201d he added, arguing that U.S. troops are also safer because there are \u201cnot 175,000 in a dangerous part in the world, there\u2019s only 15,000.\u201dThe death of Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden with little strategy\u00a0for what to do with the beheaded jihadi organization has led to the terror group splintering into multiple factions. Al Qaeda in Iraq, once led by former terror camp leader\u00a0Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, evolved into what is now known as the Islamic State, led by self-appointed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Al Qaeda affiliated militia\u00a0al-Nusra Front\u00a0has officially severed from its parent terrorist group in Syria, and continues operating as a jihadist terror group under the name \u201cJabhat Fateh al-Sham.\u201dDespite parenting new, deadly terror threats, Al Qaeda itself remains\u00a0extremely formidable, expanding out of terrorist attacks and into \u201cdrug trafficking\u00a0affiliated with Mexican drug cartels, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of arms, wildlife, coal, oil, gas, timber, precious metals, and people.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThis has enabled them not only to become independent but also richer and more powerful,\u201d according to a\u00a0Global Terrorism Index (GTI)\u00a0report.Al Qaeda has also cemented itself in regions destabilized during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, notably\u00a0Libya\u00a0and\u00a0Yemen.Kaine\u2019s claim that the Iranian nuclear deal (the \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u201d \u2013 JCPoA) eliminates the Iranian nuclear program entirely has been\u00a0proven inaccurate.The Chairman of the 9/11 Commission has said that the threat of terrorism worldwide is\u00a0greater in 2016 than in 2001. For a numerical analysis,\u00a0the Global Terrorism Index (GTI)\u00a0documented\u00a032,685 terrorist-caused deaths in 2014, compared to slightly over 5,000 in 2001.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In truth, Pence said Putin was a \u201cstronger leader\u201d than Obama, which is very different from Kaine\u2019s characterization of his remarks.\u201cI think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that\u2019s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,\u201d Pence said during an interview with Dana Bash of CNN, responding to a question about Donald Trump making a similar comment the previous evening at the Commander-in-Chief forum. Pence also noted Trump \u201csaid last night he doesn\u2019t particularly like the system\u201d in Russia. by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.Kaine used a repeated \u2014 and made-up \u2014 Obama administration talking point, citing supposed \u201cexperts\u201d inside Israeli intelligence who back the Iran deal.\u00a0In August, the Israeli government responded directly to Obama\u2019s claim \u2014 which Kaine, regrettably, repeated.As the Times of Israel reported:A top minister close to Netanyahu, meanwhile, directly contradicted Obama\u2019s assertion that Israeli security officials now back the accord. \u201cI don\u2019t know to which Israelis he (Obama) spoke recently. But I can promise you that the position of the prime minister, the defense minister and of most senior officials in the defense establishment has not changed,\u201d Tzachi Hanegbi told The Times of Israel.\u201cThe opposite is the case. The time that has elapsed since the deal was signed proved all our worries that, regrettably, we were justified before the deal was made,\u201d said Hanegbi, a minister who works in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and who until recently chaired the Knesset\u2019s powerful Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.\u00a0The Defense Ministry used more emotive language to contradict Obama.\u201cThe Israeli defense establishment believes that agreements have value only if they are based on the existing reality, but they have no value if the facts on the ground are the complete opposite of those the deal is based upon,\u201d the Ministry said in a statement.Later, Kaine repeated his claim, citing Gadi Eizenkot, one of Israel\u2019s military leaders. Eizenkot was cautiously optimistic about the deal when it went into effect, but did not say that it had stopped or eliminated Iran\u2019s nuclear program, nor even that it prevented an Iranian nuclear weapon. He said that the deal \u201chas many risks, but also presents many opportunities.\u201d That is far from Kaine\u2019s claim.by Joel B.

What a cost.\u201dThe Sun declared that Clinton\u2019s choice of \u201cone of the eight Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s address last year to a joint meeting of Congress\u201d as her running mate was \u201cone marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton\u2019s protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool\u2019s wager to count on her when the chips are down.\u201dby Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016What Senator Kaine failed to mention is that the governor of Virginia during Johns\u2019 walk-out was a Democrat named John Stewart Battle.Johns was\u00a0protesting Virginia\u2019s\u00a0segregated\u00a0public school systems.\u00a0It was in 1951 when a 16-year-old Johns walked out of her\u00a0Moton High School, an\u00a0all-black school in\u00a0Farmville, Virginia, which sat across the street from an all-white high school.\u00a0Battle, who was elected Virginia governor in 1950, was known widely as a\u00a0segregationist\u00a0\u2014 and he governed as such.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Encyclopedia of Virginia, \u201cwhen the\u00a0National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, demanded the desegregation of state parks, Battle raised the possibility of closing them instead.\u201dby Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016This is absolutely false.Indeed, during Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy on Wednesday\u00a0August 31\u00a0in Phoenix, the\u00a0Republican presidential nominee promised the audience that on \u201cday one\u201d the \u201c2 million\u00a0riminal aliens now inside of our country\u201d are \u201cgone.\u201dTrump\u00a0said\u00a0his administration will have \u201czero tolerance for criminal aliens.\u201dThe portion of\u00a0Trump\u2019s immigration speech\u00a0where he talks about deporting illegal aliens can be found below:According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens.\u00a0We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.That is not unconstitutional. That is current U.S. immigration policy. We prefer some countries over others. That is constitutional, lawful, and logical.There is no U.S. constitutional provision providing equal protection for people based on national origin \u2014 certainly when they are not yet in the United States!Kaine went further, saying that it was unconstitutional for Donald Trump to \u201ckeep them out if they\u2019re Muslim.\u201d Trump has since softened that stance somewhat, and now wants to keep people out from terror-prone countries. But regardless, the constitutional protection against religious discrimination does not apply to people who are not yet immigrants, residents or citizens.In fact, our current immigration policy \u201cdiscriminates\u201d against Muslims because it does not permit people to bring over their spouses from polygamous marriages, which are permitted in many Muslim countries. That kind of discrimination is constitutional and lawful.It would, arguably, be appropriate for the U.S. to discriminate in favor of some religions \u2014 such as Christians and Yazidis \u2014 who are subject to discrimination and persecution in the Muslim world.Regardless, it would be constitutional to do so.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: MOSTLY TRUE.Pence is right, according to a report from the Heartland Institute, a conservative policy organization.\u00a0His claim might, however, understate the role of the Second World War, which jump-started the economy \u2014 not through spending, but by relaxing many of the restrictions that had slowed recovery from the Great Depression.So others say it is simply the slowest since World War II, or 1949. Regardless, it has been slow.Kaine\u2019s numbers, by contrast, fell short. He claimed that the Obama administration had created 15 million jobs \u2014 a claim that only works if you ignore the first year of Obama\u2019s presidency, when unemployment continued to rise. Kaine overstated the number of jobs created by some 5 million.None other than the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, disputed the Clinton campaign\u2019s \u201c15 million jobs\u201d talking point: \u201cClinton frequently indicates that she\u2019s talking about the entire Obama administration. She uses phrases such \u2018than when they took office\u2019 or \u2018in the last 7 1/2 years.\u2019 But that\u2019s 5 million jobs too many.\u201dAnd that\u2019s without looking at the decline in household wealth, the rise in the number of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force, and the staggering national debt that produced virtually nothing, jobs-wise, for $10 trillion in deficit spending.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Fact Check, Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Tim KaineComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Moreover, they use numbers from last year, where Chicago homicides were far lower than they have been in 2016, to make their case.In other words, instead of comparing Indianapolis\u2019 144 murders in 2015 to Chicago\u2019s 468, The Daily Beast\u00a0compares the cities\u2019 2015 murder rates: 16.9 per 100,000 in Indianapolis, 16.7 per 100,000 in Chicago. Again, however, this completely ignores the fact that there have been 564 murders in Chicago so far this year, according to the Chicago Tribune\u00a0(and it is only October 4).Nevertheless, The Daily Beast contends that Pence ought to be called out for signing a bill that allows concealed carry permit holders to keep guns in their cars in school parking lots for self-defense and also \u201cfor\u00a0arranging for the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard in carrying concealed weapons.\u201dThe Daily Beast is also critical of Pence\u2019s actions which \u201clegalized sawed-off shotguns,\u201d but they fail to note that his actions simply brought Indiana into line with federal law: that people who wish to own a sawed-off shotgun have to go through an extensive background check\u2013including photographs and fingerprints\u2013and have to pay $200 for a federal tax stamp.While calling for Pence to be grilled on Indiana gun violence, The Daily Beast inexplicably points out that Gary, Indiana used to be \u201cknown as the murder capital of America.\u201d That changed on Pence\u2019s watch and even The Daily Beast admits one cause behind the drop in homicides is that \u201ccriminals [in Gary] have joined the exodus for better opportunities elsewhere.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

I know this\u2013believe me (to channel my inner Donald). Part of what I do for a living is prepare people\u2019s taxes in the Washington, DC area. As an Enrolled Agent, I run into all sorts of clients. The most political (that is, horse race/hot take) clients compete with performing artists for the least amount of knowledge when it comes to taxes. I\u2019ve even had some of them forget to bring their W-2s to a tax session.That ignorance was on display in vivid colors over the weekend. We were told that this tricky NOL was some sort of \u201cloophole\u201d that only super-rich bad guys like Donald Trump got to use. We were told that this relieved him of having to pay taxes for 18 years, a laughably arbitrary, made up number that is the tautological output of simple arithmetic and wild assumptions.In fact, a net operating loss is very common in businesses. As Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation\u00a0pointed out this morning, about 1 million taxpayers had an NOL in 1995. It results from business deductions exceeding business income in a particular year. Under tax rules, this loss can be carried back up to two years, and carried forward up to twenty years. If this is a \u201cloophole,\u201d what are these political reporters suggesting? That a business loss should simply be eaten by the taxpayer? That Uncle Sam should be a full partner in your profits but not in your losses? How is that fair?We also heard that real estate depreciation\u2013of all things\u2013was a loophole! Could anything be more mundane and ordinary on business tax returns than depreciation deductions? Under the consumption tax base that I and virtually all conservatives support, depreciation would be supplanted by first year full expensing (which, ironically, would cause NOLs in most cases when it comes to structures). But real estate depreciation is no loophole under any theory of tax.Read the rest of the article here.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Taxes, Donald Trump, New York TimesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak2 Oct 20160As Seth Mandel of Commentary notes, the timing of the article is odd: most of the Jewish \u201ctargets\u201d of the piece will be offline.But in the waning hours before the holiday, there is time still to point out the obvious, glaring flaw in Ben Wofford\u2019s article: it completely ignores the obvious and explicit antisemitism that is directly connected to\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Examples abound. There was the Democratic National Committee\u2019s attempt to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish,\u00a0over\u00a0his religion. There is Hillary Clinton\u2019s embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, whose platform accuses Israel of \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 an antisemitic claim that turns the victims of the Holocaust into its perpetrators. And there is Clinton\u2019s efforts to promote the writings of Max Blumenthal, an antisemite who is the son of her close associate, Sydney Blumenthal.On a policy level, Clinton backs the disastrous Iran deal, which has sent billions of dollars \u2014 including ransom money \u2014 to a regime that not only promotes Holocaust denial and the hatred of Jews, but which continues to target Jews around the world in terror attacks. And as First Lady, she embraced Yasser Arafat\u2019s wife as\u00a0the latter accused Israel of using poison gas to kill Palestinian women and children.\u00a0As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton faithfully carried out President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cdistance\u201d from Israel, whose latest snub involved\u00a0\u201ccorrecting\u201d a White House press release about Shimon Peres\u2019s funeral to deny that Jerusalem is, in fact, the capital of Israel.That is not a record of standing up to antisemitism. On the contrary, Clinton has encouraged\u00a0it.Wofford\u2019s case rests entirely on the claim that there are antisemites who support Trump. He ignores the antisemitism among Clinton\u2019s supporters.Lena Dunham, for one, published an article last year titled: \u201cDog or Jewish Boyfriend? A Quiz.\u201d The father of the Orlando terrorist turned up behind Clinton at a recent rally in Florida. And it is no accident that pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activists were in full force at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. They know their party.\u201cI support Palestinian human rights\u201d \u2013 protest signs inside the arena at #DNCinPHL pic.twitter.com/h9D40XoXzo\u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) July 25, 2016The Politico article treats antisemitism as if it were a new phenomenon, emerging in the 2016 campaign. Has Wofford been on a college campus recently? Antisemitism has been exploding, primarily as a by-product of vicious anti-Israel campaigns.At the University of California Davis last year, Muslim students taunted Jewish students with shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d at a student government meeting. Later, swastikas were found spray-painted on a Jewish fraternity. That was long before Trump.StandWithUs via FacebookThere is certainly antisemitism on the right \u2014 largely online, tweeted by anonymous trolls. The antisemitism on the left is real\u00a0and concrete.But Democrats show little interest in stopping it; indeed, their primary concern is how best to\u00a0turn the vehement activists of the anti-Israel, antisemitic far-left into volunteers and voters.Not a word of that made its way into Politico\u2019s story, which is best described as a partisan smear \u2014 and an attempt to cover up the real nature\u00a0of antisemitism in America today.Joel B.

But certainly not homicidal, and certainly not in need of a hospital stay.\u201cIt never crossed my mind that I\u2019m losing it,\u201d she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe \u2014 from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow.The woman\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump is recorded in detail:\u201cHere comes Big Daddy,\u201d she said, clapping. \u201cThe Donald. Big Daddy.\u201dKevin was snoring.\u201cHere he is, babe,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald\u2019s here, babe.\u201dTrump walked onto the stage, chanting \u201cU-S-A!

She didn\u2019t need to hear any more.\u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d she said of the 2016 presidential election, in which she was sure Trump would triumph and more and more people across the country would at last see the truth. \u201cIn my head, anyway.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald TrumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The filings show a net loss of $915,729,293 in federal taxable income for the year.That Trump was losing money during the early to mid-1990s \u2014 a period marked by bankruptcies and poor business decisions \u2014 was already well established. But the records obtained by the Times show losses of such a magnitude that they potentially allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for years, possibly until the end of the last decade.Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement on Saturday lashing out at the Times for publishing the records and accused the newspaper of working to benefit the Republican nominee\u2019s presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\u201cThe New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,\u201d the campaign said, calling Trump \u201ca highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\u201dThe statement added that Trump had paid \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in other kinds of taxes over the years.Since 1976, every major party presidential nominee has released tax returns. Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years\u2019 worth, and Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has released 10 years of his tax returns.But after initially saying that he would make his returns public during the course of his campaign, Trump switched course, citing what he said were years of ongoing IRS audits and the advice of his attorneys to keep them private as those audits proceed.Former IRS officials have expressed skepticism that anyone would be audited so frequently, and they and other tax experts say there\u2019s no prohibition on Trump releasing his returns even if he is.In its story, the Times said the three pages of documents were mailed last month to a Times reporter who had written about Trump\u2019s finances. A postmark indicated they had been sent from New York City and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower, the newspaper said.Trump\u2019s campaign did not directly address the authenticity of the excerpts from Trump\u2019s tax filings. Former Trump accountant Jack Mitnick, whose name appears as Trump\u2019s tax preparer of the filings, confirmed their authenticity, the newspaper reported.\u201cThis is legit,\u201d Mitnick told the newspaper.The Times said a lawyer for Trump argued that publication of the records would be illegal because Trump had not authorized their disclosure.Because of provisions in the tax code that allow wealthy individuals to offset their personal income with losses in various partnerships and business ventures, Trump could have used his losses in 1995 to avoid incurring tax liabilities on as many as three years of prior and 15 years of future profits.The $916 million in losses reported by the Times would not include previous years of losses incurred by Trump while his New Jersey casino empire slid into bankruptcy.In an interview, Mitnick told the Times he had sometimes found it odd that the tax code allowed Trump to live in such luxury without paying income taxes.\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Taxes, Donald Trump, New York TimesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In other words, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit. The explanation in their 2014 annual report\u00a0is, \u201cThe effective tax rate for 2014 was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.\u201d If you don\u2019t think it took fancy accountants and tax lawyers to make that happen, read the statement again.New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on Sunday, telling\u00a0NBC News\u2019\u00a0Meet the Press that Trump was a \u201cgenius\u201d in business who was simply doing what the tax code allows every American to do by counting losses against tax liabilities, and bouncing back from failure to success.That would include the\u00a0New York Times \u2014 which, however, is still struggling.As Jazz Shaw of HotAir.com\u00a0notes, the\u00a0Times\u00a0\u2014 or whoever was its source \u2014 likely obtained Trump\u2019s tax document illegally.The ongoing IRS scandal, in which the federal government targeted conservative organizations, involved\u00a0several cases in which the agency illegally shared taxpayer information with other branches of government, and in one case leaked taxpayer information to a conservative organization\u2019s political opponents.In 2008, the confidential tax information of Joe \u201cthe Plumber\u201d Wurzelbacher, who emerged as a critic of then-Sen.

Pollak2 Oct 20160Clinton\u2019s comments, recorded at a fundraiser in McLean, VA in February and published by the Washington Free Beacon, also included several other digs at Sanders and his fans, saying that he was offering them a \u201cfalse promise.\u201d But Sanders, far from taking offense, confirmed Clinton\u2019s condescending remarks.Clinton had said (emphasis added):Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the Great Recession.\u00a0And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future.Appearing on CNN\u2019s\u00a0State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Sanders said (emphasis added):Well, I agree with her. What she is saying is what I suggested a moment ago. There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and can\u2019t find decent, paying jobs. And that is\u00a0a major problem. They are living in their parents\u2019 basements. So that\u2019s the point there. So I personally do believe we do need a political revolution. That we do need to transform this society; create decent, paying jobs, make sure Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes; do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change; transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do; raise the minimum wage to a living wage; and have pay equity for women. So I think that Secretary Clinton \u2014 and by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago, she is prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration. And\u00a0on top of that, unlike Donald Trump, she understands that Citizens United\u00a0Supreme Court decision is undermining American democracy. It has got to be overturned. She will be supporting the constitutional amendment to do that so that billionaires cannot continue buying elections in this country.Asked by Tapper what he would say to a supporter who found it condescending to be described as a \u201cbasement-dwelling barista that is buying false promises from Bernie Sanders,\u201d Sanders said that supporters should choose between the candidates based on their positions on the issues.Joel B.

In July,\u00a0PolitiFact staff writer\u00a0Linda Qiu\u00a0published a piece full of\u00a0factual errors, glaring inaccuracies, and omissions.Breitbart News published a\u00a0full-scale 13-point refutation of the last Politifact Uranium One piece, which the latest one references.Kertscher\u2019s piece, however, is more of the same sloppy script.Several of the\u00a013 refutation points still apply to this latest \u201cfact-check\u201d article, but below are two additional points that deserve attention:1. It\u2019s true that the\u00a0Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has nine agencies that approved the sale of American uranium reserves. However, only one of those agencies, the Hillary Clinton-led State Department, employed a person whose family foundation collected\u00a0$145 million from investors in the deal \u2014 an alarming conflict of interest.2. PolitiFact says, \u201cGiven that Russia doesn\u2019t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One\u2019s assets in Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said.\u201dHowever, according to The New York Times,\u00a0that is patently false.As The New York Times\u00a0reports,\u00a0\u201cThe commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellow cake\u00a0to Canada even though it does not have an export license.\u201dThe\u00a0Times\u00a0report continues:Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license \u2014 which they do not have \u2014 yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that \u201cto the best of our knowledge\u201d most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.The \u201cno export\u201d assurance given at the time of the Rosatom deal is not the only one that turned out to be less than it seemed. Despite pledges to the contrary, Uranium One was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and taken private. As of 2013, Rosatom\u2019s subsidiary, ARMZ, owned 100 percent of it.Read\u00a0PolitiFact\u2019s most recent \u201cfact check\u201d in full here.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\u00a0@JeromeEHudson.Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Pre-Viral, 2016 presidential race, big journalism, Clinton Cash, Hillary Clinton, Politifact, Uranium OneComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In 2001 she published a searing account in the Atlantic about the Clinton Administration\u2019s failure to stop the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which as many as 800,000 Tutsis were killed over three months by their Hutu neighbors.Ms. Power spared no one in her depiction of the Administration\u2019s \u201calmost willful delusion\u201d about the killing, its diplomatic prevarications to avoid using the word \u201cgenocide,\u201d and its concern with how U.S. intervention would play in the midterm elections. She was particularly tough on U.S. officials who \u201cwere firmly convinced that they were doing all they could\u2014and, most important, all they should\u2014in light of competing American interests and a highly circumscribed understanding of what was \u2018possible\u2019 for the United States to do.\u201dThe essay was titled \u201cBystanders to Genocide.\u201d Ms. Power later expanded the article into a book, \u201cA Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide,\u201d for which she was widely praised. Barack Obama read the book and promoted her rise in government.Now, however, the Journal notes,\u00a0\u201cMs. Power can sound like those officials she once scolded for thinking they were doing everything they could given the complexities of the situation.\u201d It slams\u00a0some of her recent excuses for inaction, such as the complexity of the war on the ground.The war was\u00a0far\u00a0simpler when Power (and President Barack Obama) had the chance to\u00a0take decisive action, both in the early days of the Arab Spring in 2011 and after Syria violated Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons in 2013.The\u00a0Journal concludes that \u201cPower\u00a0has become an echo of the officials she once denounced for justifying American inaction in the face of mass slaughter. The honorable decision would be to resign.\u201dBreitbart News urged Power to resign in 2013, when she was still a national security adviser at the White House, in charge of a useless committee called the Atrocities Prevention Board that did nothing about Syria.The\u00a0Journal now agreed.

Pollak30 Sep 20160Donald Trump had just taken over the pageant, and fought to deal with the fallout.Hillary Clinton has, for months, planned to use that episode against him, training Machado for the attack. Here are the facts.1. Trump fought to save Machado\u2019s Miss Universe title, and her job. What is a sensitive feminist male boss supposed to do if a female employee \u2014 hired, again, for her appearance \u2014 gains a large amount of weight? He is supposed to defend her job. And that is exactly what Trump did, urging the pageant not to fire her, and appearing with her at a gym to offer support. In an excerpt from his book The Art of the Comeback, Rush Limbaugh noted Thursday, Trump recalled the episode:\u201cFirst, she wins. Second, she gains fifty pounds. Third, I urged the committee not to fire her. Fourth, I go to the gym with her in a show of support. Final act: She trashes me in the Washington Post \u2014 after I stood by her the entire time. What\u2019s wrong with this picture? Anyway, the best part about the evening was the knowledge that next year she would no longer be Miss Universe. What\u2019s maddening is that I supported her.\u201cEven in Palm Beach, where I haven\u2019t always gotten the greatest press, Shannon Donnelly, society columnist for the Palm Beach Daily News,\u201d known here as the Shiny Sheet, \u201cwrote, \u2018Here\u2019s a new one for the Donald: Protector-Advocate for large women. His acquisition from ITT has put Alicia Machado under the Trump Aegis. The Donald, bless his heart, doesn\u2019t want to fire her because \u201cit would be a terrible message to send.\u201d He is instead bringing her to the spa at Mar-a-Lago where she can work out in earnest, eat sensibly and generally decompress.\u2019 That sounds pretty gentlike to me.\u201d2. A Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him. From a 1998 news report: \u201cMachado, who grabbed world headlines for nearly losing her crown after a sudden weight gain, burst back into the limelight last month when lawyers named her as the getaway driver for her boyfriend in a shooting last November \u2026 [Judge Maximiliano] Fuenmayor, who reported the alleged threats to police, said he traced the caller through an incoming call identity function on his mobile telephone.\u201d The New York Post repored at the time that Machado \u201cwas seen driving the car in which her boyfriend, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti, sped away after shooting his brother-in-law in the head in Caracas on Nov. 21,\u201d citing the victim\u2019s family\u2019s lawyer. (He survived.) Machado denied the charges, which were later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence.3. Machado damaged her own reputation by having sex live on television. In 2005, Machado appeared on The Farm, a Spanish-language version of the Big Brother program. She had sex with the host of the show, even though she was engaged to Major League Baseball player Bobby Abreu of the Philadelphia Phillies at the time. Abreu called off the wedding after the humiliating episode aired on TV. Machado wrote of\u00a0her new lover, according to the Sun: \u201cHe treats me like a goddess, he f***s me like a b****!\u201d In 2006, she became the first Miss Universe to pose nude for\u00a0Playboy, appearing in\u00a0Playboy Mexico.4. The Clinton campaign has been coaching Machado for months to attack Trump. From the Washington Post:Operatives in Brooklyn had been working with Machado since the summer. They had a video featuring her story ready to go. Cosmopolitan had a photo spread of her draped in an American flag \u2013 to go with a profile \u2013 in the can. Machado had also conducted an interview with The Guardian that was \u201capparently embargoed for post-debate release,\u201d according to Vox. And the Clinton super PAC Priorities USA turned a digital ad to highlight the insults by early afternoon.5. Machado did, in fact, gain weight during her reign as Miss Universe. The Economist reported that she put on \u201c15 kilos within weeks of winning her title.\u201d Other newspapers called her \u201cThe Incredible Bulk.\u201d What was at issue was not her weight or appearance, but that she had just won a competition in which she voluntarily submitted herself to be judged for both \u2014 against hundreds of other contestants who would have taken her place. The Orlando Sentinel wrote: \u201cNo one, of course, raised an eyebrow when Machado basically starved herself before the competition. But when she gained anywhere from a reported 22 to 50 pounds afterward, she caused quite the international stir.\u201d Trump denies calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d or \u201cMiss Housekeeping,\u201d as Machado now claims (though he is on record at the time having called her an \u201ceating machine\u201d). Machado told the\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0that before the beauty pageant,\u00a0\u201cI was anorexic and bulimic, but almost all of us are.\u201dJoel B.

Williams, Ph.D.30 Sep 20160Progressive Christian churches that have adopted inclusivity as their defining virtue find themselves ill-equipped to oust a member, even when that member has overtly rejected the fundamental tenets of the faith.Ordained in the Canadian United Church in 1993, the Rev. Gretta Vosper slowly began doubting the truths of Christianity until she found herself an avowed atheist, denying not only the divinity of Jesus Christ but even the notion of God altogether. All this time, however, she continued to lead her church, deemphasizing questions of the supernatural while stressing community based on secular values of inclusiveness and compassion.Reports suggest that the 58-year-old pastor has a \u201cloyal following\u201d at her Protestant congregation in suburban Toronto, which she describes as a good fit for nonbelievers \u201clooking for a community that will help them create meaningful lives without God.\u201dMeanwhile, however, even in the liberal United Church of Canada, members have begun to question the suitability of a church leader who denies God\u2019s existence, especially when her resistance to faith seems to border on provocation. Vosper has announced that it is time that the Christian church gave up on \u201cthe idolatry of a theistic god.\u201dMembers of the flock have expressed their consternation in a variety of ways, wondering aloud how a declared atheist can be allowed to lead a confessionally Christian congregation.\u201cMy understanding is that the United Church of Canada is a \u2018Christian\u2019 church based on the teachings of Jesus Christ,\u201d Pamella Fell wrote on a United Church website. \u201cWhy, why, why is she still with the UCC if she isn\u2019t a Christian?\u201dA columnist in the Toronto Star even suggested that a Christian church sponsoring an atheist minister is like \u201cAlcoholics Anonymous hosting a pub crawl.\u201dIn the face of the uproar over this glaring contradiction, a special committee of the Toronto Conference of the United Church has finally taken action, and earlier this month requested that the Church\u2019s General Council conduct a formal hearing of the case.\u201cIn our opinion, she is not suitable to continue in ordained ministry because she does not believe in God, Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit. Ms. Vosper does not recognize the primacy of scripture, she will not conduct the sacraments, and she is no longer in essential agreement with the statement of doctrine of The United Church of Canada,\u201d the divided committee said in its report.And still the United Church, which prides itself on its inclusiveness, is treating the matter gingerly, reluctant to declare anything off-limits.\u201cAt the heart of the concerns being raised is a tension between two core values, both of which are central to our identity as United Church. The first is our faith in God. The second is our commitment to being an open and inclusive church,\u201d wrote the Right Reverend Jordan Cantwell, head (moderator) of the United Church of Canada.The crux of the matter seems to be that for a church that has progressively embraced every aspect of secular culture, it has become hard to say \u201cno\u201d to anything. With a wink to the Bible, the United Church has accepted abortion and same-sex marriage and divorce and female ordination and openly gay ministers. But atheism seems a bridge too far.In other words, for the United Church, it\u2019s all right to \u201cmold\u201d your idea of God so that he (or she) can approve of homosexual sex and trangenderism and killing babies in the womb, but please don\u2019t deny the divinity outright.Then again, for Canada\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, perhaps atheism is the greatest \u201cprotest\u201d of all. \u201cFor some,\u201d wrote Rev. Cantwell, having an atheist minister \u201cis simply a natural extension of our commitment to be an open, inclusive, and questioning church,\u201d adding that \u201cdiversity in our church has been and will continue to be a source of strength.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tough on the United Church because we\u2019ve created this mantra of inclusiveness and now it\u2019s been tested,\u201d said the Rev. Don Schweitzer, a professor of theology at St. Andrew\u2019s College in Saskatoon. \u201cIt goes against the grain to tell somebody that you have to leave.\u201dFollow Thomas D.

The new paragraph still includes the correlation between Sharon\u2019s visit and the outbreak of violence, stating:\u201cConflict between Israel and the Palestinians accelerated in 2000 after a visit by the opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the sacred plaza in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.\u201dHowever, as HonestReporting.com notes, Palestinians themselves do not think that Sharon was the instigator of the Second Intifada.A few months after the incident, Palestinian Authority Communications Minister Imad Al-Faluji Al-Safir, said in a recorded interview:Whoever thinks that the Intifada broke out because of the despised Sharon\u2019s visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque is wrong. That was only the straw breaking the Palestinian people\u2019s patience. This Intifada was planned in advance, ever since President [Yasser] Arafat\u2019s return from the Camp David negotiations, where he turned the table upside down on President [Bill] Clinton.Yasser Arafat\u2019s wife Suha said the following:On the personal level, I miss him very, very much. [Our daughter] Zahwa also misses him, you can\u2019t imagine. She didn\u2019t know him. She knows that Arafat sent us away before the [Israeli] invasion of Ramallah. He said: \u201cYou have to leave Palestine, because I want to carry out an Intifada, and I\u2019m not prepared to shield myself behind my wife and little girl.\u201d Everyone said: \u201cSuha abandoned him,\u201d but I didn\u2019t abandon him. He ordered me to leave him because he had already decided to carry out an Intifada after the Oslo Accords and after the failure of Camp David [in July 2000].American diplomat Dennis Ross recounts how Israel had called on Washington to warn them that they had evidence the Palestinians were \u201cplanning massive, violent demonstrations throughout the West Bank and the next morning, ostensibly a response to the Sharon visit.\u201dWashington subsequently urged Arafat to stem the violence, but the Palestinian leader, according to Ross \u2013 \u201cdid not lift a finger to stop the demonstrations, which produced the Second Intifada.\u201dIn addition, the Mitchell Report investigating the Intifada, which was submitted to then-president George W. Bush, found categorically that \u201cThe Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada.\u201dBig Journalism, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Ariel Sharon, conflict, Error, HonestReporting, Israel, New York Times, PA communications minister, Palestinian Terrorism, second intifada, Temple Mount, ViolenceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Cuba is not \u2014 it\u2019s not right what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s not right,\u201d Trump said at the rally.\u201cThis afternoon I spent a lot of time in Little Havana, an amazing place,\u201d he added. \u201cPresident Obama made a one-sided deal with the Castros for nothing in return. Did you ever see this guy make a decent deal for this country?\u201dThe Newsweek piece garnered a lot of mainstream media television coverage, receiving airtime on MSNBC, CNN, ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and Spanish-language outlet Univision.Some dispute the veracity of the suggestion\u00a0of impropriety\u00a0in Eichenwald\u2019s piece. According to a post on Capitol Hill Cubans, a blog edited by\u00a0Mauricio Claver-Carone,\u00a0the executive director of Cuba Democracy Advocates, there is no evidence Trump directly transacted business with the Cuban government.\u201cHowever, Trump never transacted business with the Castro regime, as the Newsweek article claims. To the contrary, Trump concluded that those who seek to do business with the Castro regime were mistaken.\u201dCapitol Hill Cubans pointed to a 1999 Miami Herald op-ed by Trump where he said human rights take priority over huge profits.Eichenwald acknowledges neither Trump nor any of the parties directly involved are likely to face prosecution because the statute of limitations ran out long ago.Instead, Eichenwald ponders how the Cuban-American voting bloc may react to this news.\u201cWhat would happen if Trump\u2019s Cuban-American supporters ever found out?\u201d Eichenwald writes at the end of his piece.Others have speculated on what this could mean for Trump in Florida as well.\u201cThe revelations come just as the Republican presidential candidate began making a big push to curry the support of Cuban-Americans who live in Miami-Dade, Florida\u2019s most-populous county with the most Republicans, 366,000. About 72 percent of them are Hispanic, nearly all Cuban-American,\u201d Marc Caputo wrote in Thursday\u2019s edition of Politico Florida\u2019s Playbook.Winning Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes is vital for both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s path to the White House.

Pollak29 Sep 20160Their agenda\u00a0is obvious: voters like winners, so making Clinton an even bigger winner could be a way to improve her poll numbers. But the hyperbole is helping Trump set expectations that guarantee he wins the next two debates.As this author predicted, Trump would lose the first debate, largely because Clinton\u2019s health problems\u00a0lowered expectations for her, even below where they had been for Trump. Initially, Trump faced lower expectations, because he is less experienced at debates. But after Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial, some observers wondered whether she could stand\u00a0through a full 90 minutes of debating. She did that \u2014 with nary a cough.\u00a0Moderator Lester Holt also weighed in heavily in Clinton\u2019s favor.Yet, as this author explained after the debate, Trump\u2019s loss in the first debate made it likely\u00a0that he will win the second and third debates. There are five reasons. First, Trump will now benefit from low expectations in the second debate that carry over into the third, since his first win\u00a0will still\u00a0be seen as a fluke. Second, the moderators will be under pressure to be less biased than Holt was. Third, Trump will benefit from the town hall format in the second debate, because he has spoken more often to real voters than Clinton has done recently. Fourth, Trump has home field advantage in Las Vegas for the third debate. And fifth, Trump\u2019s improvement over time will\u00a0show that he can learn\u00a0on the job, as he will have to do in the White House.Had Trump actually melted down on Monday, as the New York Times\u2018 Charles Blow pretends,\u00a0any mistakes in later debates would have reinforced that first impression. But because he was competent, even while losing, Trump set himself up for wins.Perhaps fearing a comeback, Trump\u2019s critics are trying to squeeze every possible advantage out of Clinton\u2019s win on Monday. But they are setting him up for even bigger wins \u2014 and setting Clinton up for a fall.Take, for example, Paul Waldman, writing at The Week. He predicts that Clinton will win the second debate \u2014 and his reasons come down to preconceived notions\u00a0of the candidates: Trump as a blustering fool, Clinton as not only smart but also empathic. Waldman actually declares,\u00a0without any irony, that \u201crelating to other humans one-on-one is something Hillary Clinton is actually very good at\u201d \u2014 something that we know from opinion polls is not true, and which her campaign also knows is untrue, since they do not allow it to happen often.Waldman also argues Trump is incapable of learning or\u00a0improvement. That flies in the face of Trump\u2019s improved polls since mid-August, when he became a more disciplined candidate.It also sets expectations so low Trump is certain to clear them.Joel B.

If Netanyahu wants peace, let him abide by the requirements of international law, the two-state solution, and the 1967 boundaries.\u2019\u2019The editorial, published Sunday in the Saudi Gazette, suggested that the Palestinians \u201cshould not be too quick to dismiss the invitation,\u201d adding that it was \u201creminiscent of the one issued by former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to visit Israel\u201d that led to the signing of a\u00a0peace treaty between the erstwhile enemies.\u201cFor all its shortcomings, Camp David demonstrated that negotiations with Israel were possible and that progress could be made through sustained efforts at communication and cooperation,\u2019\u2019 it added.\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s gesture was quickly rejected by the Palestinians as a \u2018new gimmick,\u2019\u201d the Saudi newspaper editorial said.For her\u00a0part, Ashrawi said the Egypt-Israel scenario was not analogous to the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of Egypt and Israel, two countries that wanted to make peace, it\u2019s a question of an occupying force that is destroying the other state and it\u2019s about people under occupation who have no rights and no power,\u201d the Jerusalem Post cited Ashrawi as saying.Ashrawi asserted her belief that \u201cbelow the surface there are contacts [between Israel and Saudi Arabia] and all sorts of security considerations and Israel is positioning itself to be a regional power.\u2019\u2019 But she added: \u201cNo matter what happens, they won\u2019t recognize or normalize with Israel because it hasn\u2019t respected Palestinian rights and international law.

Since most people stopped paying attention after the first 30 minutes, that\u2019s a win for Trump.Hillary supporters, or \u201cthe media,\u201d had reason to be happy: She looked healthy! She probably could have kept reciting her snarky little talking points for another hour.In fact, it was the best I\u2019ve ever seen Hillary. She avoided that honking thing she does, smiled a lot \u2014 a little too much, actually (maybe ease up on the pep pills next time) \u2014 and, as the entire media has gleefully reported, she managed to \u201cbait\u201d Trump.Note to the Trump campaign: While it may seem studly that Hillary\u2019s best performance versus Trump\u2019s worst ends in a draw, on Nov. 9, no one wants to say:\u00a0We almost won \u2014 and our guy didn\u2019t prepare!The media\u2019s excitement over Hillary successfully \u201cbaiting\u201d Trump is revealing \u2014 of the media, of what this election is really about, and of what Trump needs to do now.The definition of Trump \u201ctaking the bait\u201d was getting him to talk about himself, not about issues. This from a media that claim to be aching for \u201cpolicy specifics.\u201dHillary \u2014 with assists from the moderator \u2014 \u201cbaited\u201d Trump on how rich he is, the loan from his father, a lawsuit in 1972, the birther claims, who he said what to about the Iraq War from 2001 to 2003, and so on.For the media, their gal was winning whenever precious minutes of a 90-minute debate were spent rehashing allegations about Trump.\u00a0Ha ha! We prevented Trump from talking about issues that matter to the American people!\u00a0That was scored as a \u201cwin.\u201dNothing illustrates more clearly that this election is about the people versus the elites than the fact that the media run from Trump\u2019s issues like Dracula from the sun.Trump wins whenever he talks about issues; he loses whenever he talks about himself.Trump was winning when he talked about the heinous trade deals that have shipped jobs abroad and immiserated millions of Americans \u2014 which Hillary supports. He was winning when he talked about bringing order and safety to black neighborhoods overrun with crime; Hillary\u2019s with the criminals. He was winning when he talked about rebuilding our inner cities, instead of saying, \u201cVote for me!\u201d then, \u201cSee you in four years!\u201d \u2014 as Hillary does.Unlike the media, ordinary people don\u2019t care about Trump\u2019s taxes or net worth or the things he said as an entertainer. Trump will be dead and gone in 30 years. But whether America continues to exist or becomes some dystopian blend of Guatemala and Afghanistan will be determined by this election.It\u2019s almost impossible not to correct a lie, especially about yourself, which is why Hillary and Lester Holt\u2019s \u201cbaiting\u201d strategy was to make outrageous claims about Trump.Hillary, for example, criticized Trump for not releasing his tax returns, saying, \u201cmaybe \u2026 he\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes.\u201dThis is exactly what Sen. Harry Reid stated as hard fact about Romney in 2012 \u2014 on the Senate floor, so he couldn\u2019t be sued. After the election was over, Reid was asked about this obvious falsehood. He laughed it off and said, \u201cRomney didn\u2019t win, did he?\u201dThis is the game they play.Trump has got to learn to ignore it. The voters have. They don\u2019t care about his taxes. They want jobs, they want a wall and they\u2019d like fewer Muslims showing up, collecting welfare, then killing Americans.Trump doesn\u2019t have to do formal debate practice, standing at a podium, facing off against a shorty in pantsuit. But he does need Pavlovian training to stop responding to irrelevancies.This isn\u2019t about him! It\u2019s about a movement of the people to take back their government from an arrogant plutocracy.From now until the next debate, every single person who works for Trump should personally insult him several times a day.Good morning, sir \u2014 your business is a total fraud.\u00a0Here are those trade stats you wanted \u2014 oh and you lied about opposing the war in Iraq.\u00a0The Cincinnati airport needs a tail number \u2014 why did you \u201cfat-shame\u201d that poor girl?If he starts to respond, they should say, \u201cNo one cares, sir. Tell me how you\u2019re going to stop Mexican drugs from pouring across our border.\u201dThe proof that voters don\u2019t care about the personal attacks on Trump is that, even after his lazy and self-indulgent debate performance, he won nearly every online poll.Evidently, the American people have sized up the candidates and decided they want Trump. But there\u2019s just one last formality: He needs to pass some minimum threshold, a basic job requirement \u2013 like proving he has a drivers license.Everybody agrees he\u2019s got the job. It\u2019s too late for Hillary to be sucking up to the hiring committee, reminding them,\u00a0but I took driver\u2019s ed seven times \u2014 yes, there were mistakes, but I was grilled for 11 hours about that vehicular homicide. Also, the Russians hacked my GPS.Trump showed up at the debate with his driver\u2019s license.

So why ask it again \u2014 when the first time was already a weird red herring?Per the transcript of the debate, Trump used moderator and NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt\u2019s final question to pivot to a broader issue on\u00a0immigration, before answering it directly:HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We\u2019re losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don\u2019t even know.HOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?TRUMP: Look, here\u2019s the story. I want to make America great again. I\u2019m going to be able to do it. I don\u2019t believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.Later in the spin room, an NBC correspondent \u2014 not clearly identified but sounding like Hallie Jackson \u2014 repeated the question. As video from NBC shows, this reporter asked only one question as Trump made his way through a line of reporters, and she chose as her only contribution to the post-debate discussion: \u201cWill you accept the outcome of the election?\u201dTrump responded, \u201cOh yes, absolutely. I will.\u201dThe odd emergence of this topic calls to mind the 2012 election, when ABC News anchor and former Clinton White House employee George Stephanopoulos bizarrely raised the topic of birth control during a Republican primary debate, baffling then-candidate Mitt Romney. That issue became a line of attack for President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, fueling speculation of collusion between the White House and the establishment media.It also brings back memories of the first Republican debate in 2015, where moderator Bret Baier opened by asking the candidates to pledge their support to whoever won the primary race. Trump was the only person on stage who raised his hand to avoid that commitment. Perhaps NBC\u2019s producers were hoping for a similar contrarian moment on a no-brainer unity question.They wanted Trump to urge his supporters to reject the election results and cause widespread chaos \u2014 to sound like a Nicol\u00e1s Maduro or some other caudillo, a big theme in the Never Trump movement. They wanted to plant a meme that Trump may encourage a violent coup, even a civil war\u00a0\u2014 so they can blame him for any more violence against his supporters.However, Trump quickly\u00a0shut it down, with an \u201cabsolute\u201d yes \u2014 even when they tried to fish for a gaffe a second time.That second time obviously won\u2019t be the last we hear of this silly question. Much like the 2012 birth control narrative and repeated\u00a0questions about David Duke, the establishment media will keep bringing up this topic until they get an answer that helps their preferred candidate.As I watched the debate aftermath last night, one moment was especially saddening. A\u00a0member of CNN\u2019s debate focus group said she was disappointed that the candidates did not discuss substantive issues; the one she wanted to hear about most was health care. If the post-debate spin room questions were any indication,\u00a0\u201cprofessional\u201d journalists will continue to disappoint her for quite a long time.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Hallie Jackson, Lester Holt, nbc news, Presidential DebateComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

That night, soldiers bulldozed the house, killing him. His wife Hadeel Odeh, who was not with her husband at the time, is six months pregnant.\u201dMedia watchdog HonestReporting.com charged NPR was in \u201cbreach of journalistic ethics\u201d by failing to include critical context.\u201cNPR\u2019s version of events gives the impression that [Mohammed] Fakih was a victim who was bulldozed to death in his home, rather than a terrorist who had turned his home into an armed camp and his neighborhood into a war zone,\u201d the watchdog reported.The raid, conducted jointly by police, Shin Bet security forces and the IDF, revealed that Fakih was in possession of a weapons cache including a Kalashnikov rifle and a homemade grenade.Earlier in July, Rabbi Miki Mark was murdered by Fakih and other members of a terror cell in a drive-by shooting near his West Bank home while his wife and two of his children were in the car. Chava Mark was critically wounded in the attack.The NPR segment focused on an incident that occurred immediately after the attack. A Palestinian man and his wife, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of backlash, \u00a0came to the Mark family\u2019s aid, likely saving their lives by pulling the Mark children out of the car and administering first aid until emergency responders arrived at the scene.The good Samaritan suffered terrible consequences as the result of helping Jewish Israelis. He suffered public humiliation and insults by fellow Palestinians and was fired from his job. This turn of events caused the head of the local Jewish settlers\u2019 council, Yochai Damari, to become involved. Damari, who met with the man, launched a campaign calling on Israel\u2019s government to give the man a permit to work in Israel.As HonestReporting notes, NPR is to be commended for reporting the story, which illustrates the \u201ckind of depth and complexity that we rarely see in mainstream media\u201d surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.It\u2019s just a shame that the radio show made such a \u201ccritical and disturbing error\u201d in its account of the terrorist\u2019s death, the report said.NPR is not the first media outlet to report on the incident with blatant\u00a0inaccuracies.The BBC ran a headline stating: \u201cIsraeli forces shoot dead Palestinian suspected of killing rabbi\u201d with only one tiny mention of the firefight buried at the end of the article and qualified by the disclaimer, \u201cIsraeli media reports said.\u201dBig Journalism, Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart TV, Army, BBC, bias, Fakih, gun fight, IDF, Israel, Murderer, NPR< National Public Radio, Palestinian assailant, Rabbi Miki Mark, Shin Bet, Shoot Out, skewed reporting, terrorist, West BankComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak27 Sep 20160Holt faced unrelenting pressure from the Clinton campaign and the liberal media to \u201cfact-check\u201d Trump \u2014 and Holt did just that, serving as a Clinton campaign surrogate for most of the evening. And his press corps peers are pleased: Politico\u2019s Hadas Gold actually claimed: \u201cLester Holt stays out of the way.\u201dIn reality, however, Holt was even worse than CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley, who famously fact-checked Mitt Romney (incorrectly) in the second presidential debate in 2012. Crowley only intervened once, while Holt\u00a0interjected\u00a0five times to \u201ccorrect\u201d Trump, often with false information. The most egregious example was when Holt claimed that New York\u2019s \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy had been declared unconstitutional. Trump pushed back, correctly noting that the courts had never settled the issue because New York\u2019s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, had dropped the policy despite ample evidence that it had slashed crime in the city.Many of Holt\u2019s questions for Trump were straight out of the Clinton campaign\u2019s talking points, setting up the Democratic nominee for a well-rehearsed ambush. He asked Trump about his tax returns and the Birther theory, and\u00a0even cast Trump\u2019s past criticism of Clinton as sexist. Holt never asked Clinton about her emails, about the Benghazi terror attack, or about the Clinton Foundation. He also pressed Trump on his statements about the Iraq War, never asking Clinton about her\u00a0actual vote.Gold notes that Holt never asked Trump about his immigration policies, either. But that was because when Trump tried to turn the conversation towards immigration, Hold turned it back to Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate:TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.HOLT: I will let you respond. It\u2019s important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You\u2019ve continued to tell the story and question the president\u2019s legitimacy in 2012, \u201913, \u201914, \u201915\u2026Moreover, as one observer noted, while Trump faced six follow-up questions, Clinton faced none. It is true that Holt \u201cstayed out of the way\u201d \u2014 out of Clinton\u2019s way. But\u00a0Holt did his best to make himself\u00a0an obstacle between Donald Trump and the presidency.\u00a0He undermined his credibility as a newsman, but earned a place in journalism\u2019s left-wing elite.Joel B.

But the shocking answer given by several of the girls \u2013 which compelled me to argue with them \u2013 was that they were fans of Hitler!\u201d she wrote in article published earlier this year and translated this week by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).\u201cI interrupted one of the girls who said that Hitler was her favorite figure, asking her: \u2018Are you serious or joking?\u2019 She looked at me, amazed, and replied: \u2018Yes, I am serious.\u2019 This led another girl to add: \u2018I too love Hitler\u2019s personality.\u2019 I asked the first girl: \u2018What do you like about Hitler\u2019s personality?\u2019 She responded, very confidently: \u2018His strength, and his ability to unite his country\u2019s military and leadership and to stand fast in war.\u2019 I asked her: \u2018Do you realize that his strength caused an entire world war, and the destruction of Germany and France?\u2019 She responded: \u2018Yes. I read his book Mein Kampf and was impressed by his strength, his faith, and his perseverance.\u2019\u201d\u201cI told her: \u2018But Hitler was a dictator who heeded nothing but his inner voice, and was a racist who recognized only the German Aryan race.\u2019 She responded: \u2018So what? It was enough that he was strong!\u2019\u201d the writer added.Al-Banna assessed that the trend stems from the wave of extreme violence and instability sweeping the Arab world and the sense of helplessness young people feel.She\u00a0said the incident compelled her to investigate\u00a0further, and doing so revealed that the \u201cfandom\u201d of Hitler adoration was widespread among Arab youth who feel he was a figure who \u201cchallenged the world with his strength.\u201d\u201cSome said they admired him for killing the Jews, but most were enchanted by his strength, determination, and steadfastness,\u201d she writes.Al-Banna noted that one of the girls she spoke to said she was also a fan of Che Guevara for being a\u00a0\u201cstrong militant personality.\u201dShe\u00a0responding by telling the girl of the \u201cdifference between Hitler\u2019s racist and dictatorial values and Che Guevara\u2019s universal values, which favor the oppressed peoples and strive for justice and liberation.\u201dAl-Banna asserted that younger generations are developing \u201ctwisted values,\u201d which include a desire for power and control as well as challenging the \u201cother.\u201dThis phenomenon \u201creflects the reality of a crisis-ridden, unstable society,\u201d and is manifest in everything\u00a0from \u201csuppression of free expression to the use of extreme violence on all levels \u2013 verbal, physical\u201d and online violence, she concludes.Big Journalism, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Al-Banna, Al-Watan, Arab youth, Arabs love Hitler, aryan, Bahrain, Fuhrer, Hitler, Nazi, Racist, strongComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak26 Sep 20160Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign\u2019s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing \u2014 not asking \u2014 that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her \u201csuper-predator\u201d remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to \u201cwhite Americans\u201d in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of \u201cstop-and-frisk,\u201d Holt interjected to bolster Clinton\u2019s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over.\u201cA presidential look.\u201d Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have \u201ca presidential look.\u201d He did so after noting that Clinton had become \u201cthe first woman\u201d to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump\u2019s past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote.In addition, the audience repeatedly interjected \u2014 almost always in Clinton\u2019s favor \u2014 and Holt did not stop them, though it was against the rules. He only stopped the audience when there were cheers for Trump calling for Clinton\u2019s emails.Bow again, Lester Holt. You did your job.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Pollak26 Sep 2016011:00 p.m. EDT: Poor FactCheck.org. Their website crashed during the debate.We are experiencing technical difficulties on our website. Sorry!\u2014 FactCheck.org (@factcheckdotorg) September 27, 2016Viewers were left to think for themselves. The HORROR.10:20 p.m. EDT: Lester Holt bows to the Clinton campaign, and tries to \u201cfact-check\u201d Trump on his support for (or opposition to) the Iraq War.It happens thus: Holt introduces, matter-of-factly, the premise that Trump supported the Iraq War. Trump pushes back, calling it \u201cmainstream media nonsense.\u201d Trump burns two minutes explaining how he did not support the war, citing Howard Stern and Sean Hannity.At the end, Holt repeats the allegation again anyway. This is what the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media wanted him to do.In one gesture, Holt proves everything that conservatives allege about mainstream media moderators, NBC News, and \u201cfact-checking.\u201d10:07 p.m. EDT: The self-proclaimed fact-checkers join moderator Lester Holt and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for a real-time demonstration of how so-called \u201cfact-checking\u201d is really a guise for deliberate political attacks.\nStep 1: Moderator asks setup question. In a segment on race relations, Holt asks Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory. He asks no similar questions about Clinton\u2019s record, leaving Trump himself to bring up such Clinton hits as \u201csuperpredator.\u201d Trump also notes that the Birther conspiracy theory started in the Clinton campaign.Step 2: Democrat pounces on setup question. Clinton goes to town on Trump\u2019s Birther past, denying her own. Trump counters, again, with examples of racism from Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign. But then\u2026Step 2a: Moderator interrupts Trump\u2019s response. Holt reminds Trump that the segment is about race relations. Just to reinforce the underlying charge of racism.Step 3: Fact-checker gives Trump a \u201cfalse.\u201d PolitiFact tweets a link to an article from Sep. 16 claiming that neither Clinton nor her campaign had anything to do with the Birther conspiracy theory. Of course they did, as Clinton\u2019s campaign manager admitted. Trump points that out \u2014 and perhaps that is effective, but the point is that the left\u2019s so-called \u201cfact-checking\u201d machine completes the cycle.\nTo review: Moderator sets up attack, Democrat attacks, fact-checker removes Republican\u2019s defense.9:58 p.m. EDT: Trump fact-checks Clinton when she claims crime is down in New York, including murder.Trump is right. Crime was down overall in New York last year, but murder, rape, and robbery were up, according to the Wall Street Journal.We don\u2019t need no fact-checkers\u20269:49 p.m. EDT: Trump fact-checks the moderator.\nHolt: Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York\u2026Trump: No, you\u2019re wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.\nFact Wreck rating: Trump is 100% right, according to the New York Times and Holt\u2019s collusion with Clinton is becoming hard to ignore.9:47 p.m. EDT: The left\u2019s pressure on moderator Lester Holt seems to have worked, as he raises the question of Trump\u2019s tax returns (not yet disclosed) but says nothing about Clinton\u2019s missing emails, leaving that to Trump to raise on his own.FactCheck.org does not bother to fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s false rebuttal, which is that she made a \u201cmistake\u201d (which she originally claimed was a mistake of using only one phone, when she in fact had 13). Instead, the organization simply refers to a \u201cguide\u201d to Hillary\u2019s emails.9:25 p.m. EDT: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both refer viewers to fact-checking services on their campaign websites.The media fact-checkers are about to go out of business.9:22 p.m. EDT: Hillary Clinton fact-checks Donald Trump, after he says that she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership before she opposed it.\nClinton: That is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated\u2026Trump: \u2026You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it\u2019s the finest deal you\u2019d ever seen.\u201dClinton: No.\nActually, she did. CNN (!) counted 45 times Clinton pushed the deal.PolitiFact notes that Clinton did, indeed, flip-flop on the deal:\nLIVE FACT-CHECK: Trump is right, Clinton flip-flopped on TPP https://t.co/howNkUisAE pic.twitter.com/V70SDG3MAY\u2014 PolitiFact Live (@politifactlive) September 27, 2016\nWas that necessary, though? Trump just pointed it out.9:18 p.m. EDT:\u00a0Donald Trump fact-checks Hillary Clinton. She said:\u00a0\u201cDonald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.\u201d He denied it.He did, in fact, tweet\u00a0in 2012 that the Chinese invented the concept of \u201cglobal warming\u201d for their own benefit. He later said he was joking.Candidates fact-checking each other. What a concept.9:16 p.m. EDT: FactCheck.org has two fact checks so far, both of Trump. And not because Hillary\u2019s been more truthful.Thus far, the 1st factual error in #debatenight is @HillaryClinton saying the US doesn\u2019t yet have \u201cequal pay for equal work.\u201d Fact-checkers?\u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 27, 20169:12 p.m. EDT:\u00a0Alex Burns of the\u00a0New York Times files the first fact check of the evening, complaining about Trump\u2019s claims about Ford moving jobs to Mexico. But Burns \u2014 and, thus far, the rest of the fact-checkers \u2014 missed the actual first false statement by any of the candidates.The whopper came from Clinton, who suggested that the U.S. does not yet have \u201cequal pay for equal work,\u201d something that has been a matter of law for decades. (The remaining inequality, such as it is, is largely due to factors such as career choice and time off for children.)8:58 p.m. EDT: FactCheck.org calls NBC News host Lester Holt a \u201cmoderate.\u201d It\u2019s just a typo, but why not?\nModerate Lester Holt says that hopefully it will be \u201cjust the two of them tonight,\u201d and he will facilitate the discussion.\u2014 FactCheck.org (@factcheckdotorg) September 27, 2016\nActually, Holt\u2019s political affiliation has been a part of the pre-debate controversy. Trump called Holt a Democrat; he is actually a registered Republican. (Fun fact: Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace is apparently a registered Democrat.) According to political scientist Tim Groseclose, more than 90% of political journalists are registered Democrats, while some 7% identify as Republican.Ostensibly, \u201cfact-checking\u201d aims to help the public make more\u00a0informed decisions, both by helping them see past the candidates\u2019 political spin, and by helping them see\u00a0which candidates are more truthful. In practice, \u201cfact-checking\u201d is weighted against Republicans, largely because fact-checkers evaluate Republicans more than Democrats.When fact-checkers do scrutinize Democrats, the party of the left often enjoys the benefit of the doubt. For example, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton first faced questions about whether she used her secret private email server to send or receive classified material, the\u00a0Washington Post gave her a mere two Pinocchios (out of four) when she claimed she had not.\u00a0For months, evidence mounted that Clinton had lied. Only when FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton had, indeed, exchanged classified material through her email server \u2014\u00a0while declining to prosecute her for the same \u2014 did the\u00a0Post upgrade its rating from two to four Pinocchios.Conversely, fact-checkers often punish Republicans\u00a0for\u00a0statements that are factually correct. For example, Politifact rated as \u201cfalse\u201d a statement by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) claiming that President Barack Obama had promised to dismantle Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But Cotton\u2019s statement was, in fact, completely accurate.In the run-up to Monday\u2019s first presidential debate, Democrats and media pundits have urged moderator Lester Holt to fact-check Republican nominee Donald Trump during the debate. It is dubious advice, given the disastrous precedent of CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley, who erroneously fact-checked Republican Mitt Romney during the second debate in 2012. The pressure has another purpose, which is to cast\u00a0Trump as more dishonest than Clinton.It is well past time to fact-check the fact-checkers.Check for regular updates during Monday\u2019s first presidential debate.Joel B.

How The Media Covered For Orlando Terrorist Omar Mateen", "id": "post-5117834", "content": "by Raheem Kassam26 Sep 20160Despite the drastic attempts by the establishment media to portray Mr. Mateen as a scorned, mentally ill, repressed homosexual, the documents reveal one crucial point: Omar Mateen ranted at the police about America\u2019s fight against the Islamic State, mentioning the war and air strikes at least 20 times in total.There had previously only been summaries of the 17 pages released by the FBI, which gave media outlets the wiggle room to try and portray Mr. Mateen as something other than an Islamic fundamentalist. He is even as specific, throughout the conversations, telling police his motive was the death of Abu Wahib, and Islamic State commander killed by U.S. backed forces in May.But the establishment media went to significant lengths to cover for Mr. Mateen and his motives:The Washington Post, increasingly recognised for its spin rather than news coverage, reported that \u201cMateen claimed allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2026 no evidence had emerged by late Sunday pointing to actual ties to terrorist groups or a significant association with jihadist causes\u201d.They describe Mateen as having a \u201cblemish free record\u201d and underscored their point with a quote from U.S. President Barack Obama who said: \u201cWe have reached no definitive conclusions\u201d.It\u2019s not terrible that wire agencies liek AP report the words of Mateen\u2019s imam. But let\u2019s have some context maybe? Is it likely the imam was going to blame radical Islam? Is he a credible or reliable source? The answer of course is no, but AP doesn\u2019t provide any context such as a similar denial by the Tablighi Jamaat mosque representatives during the San Bernardino shooting. The American public deserves to know these religious leaders first job is to protect Islam, not be reliable news sources.While evidently an attack on an LGBT nightclub, Mateen doesn\u2019t mention his target once in his very frank exchange with the police in the transcript. If the two men kissing in downtown Miami was really his motive, why did he rant about Syria and Abu Wahib?His ex-wife said he had strong views on homosexuality, which may have been true and may have served as a rationale for him picking the Pulse nightclub to target. But what is deeply obvious from this transcript is that he was a man hell bent on revenge \u2013 deranged by it, even \u2013 for the U.S. involvement in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State targets.Politico so badly wanted this to be a \u201crevenge\u201d attack on a lover, rather than Islamic terrorism, they relied on a dubious Univision interview with a man named \u201cMiguel\u201d who claimed to be Mateen\u2019s lover. But this was even after the FBI already declared none of its investigations had found any evidence of a secret, gay, double life from Mateen. Instead, as one gay dating website spokesman put it, it looks to have been a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 and one that the media went for, hook, line, and sinker. Why? Because \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d was a conclusion they never wanted to have to reach.Except that\u2019s not really what CIA director John Brennan said. What he was talking about was a \u201cdirect\u201d (that\u2019s the quote) link between Mateen and ISIS operatives. Which is to say he was not communicating with someone in Syria who was directing him. But who thought he was? Maybe the Guardian did, but as we know a lot of these ISIS operatives and cells are \u201cinspired\u201d rather than instructed. Instead, their instructions emanate from magazines, videos, and social media. But this headline was clearly too good to pass up for the Guardian.Like U.S. President Obama, the media was unwilling to follow the obvious links, and ones that are now so glaringly obvious given the transcript details.No doubt many of these outlets will now fall back on his the claim that Mateen was simply using ISIS as a cover up for his repressed homosexuality.But demonising gay people is easier than attributing blame to Muslim terrorists.Follow Raheem Kassam on TwitterBig Journalism, Jihad, National Security, ISIS, Islamic State, islamic terror, Omar Mateen, Orlando, Pulse nightclubComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

And Trump himself has questioned Clinton\u2019s stamina.At Mediaite\u00a0there was a similar tut-tut:King is known for embracing firebrand positions that occasionally reflect anti-immigrant and racially-charged stances, and he has made his support for Trump quite clear in the past. Today, he decided to add fuel to the #HillarysHealth theories by suggesting that Clinton will be pre-medicated at tonight\u2019s debate.Clinton has been subject to numerous accusations of being physically and mentally unfit to be president, which were emboldened after she went through her recent bout of pneumonia.

Rape rose by 6.3 percent. Burglaries fell by 7.8 percent while larceny-thefts dropped 1.8 percent. Vehicle thefts increased by 3.1 percent and property crimes, not including arson, cost victims $14.3 billion. During the year, property-related crime dropped by 2.6 percent.Media coverage emphasized the impact of the crime rise on the popularity of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.The Washington Post: \u201cViolent crime and murders both went up in 2015, FBI says\u201dThe long-awaited FBI report was released\u00a0amid heightened scrutiny of violent crime in the United States, propelled by an increase in homicides in a number of major cities and repeated comments from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2026The FBI statistics\u00a0were released just hours before Trump and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, meet for their first presidential debate. Crime and law enforcement have become major themes of this campaign, with Trump framing himself as a candidate of law and order and regularly\u00a0invoking increases in homicides (particularly in Chicago, which led the country in killings last year\u00a0and far outpaces any other city so far this year)\u2026Trump\u2019s comments on the subject, part of a campaign pitch that\u00a0describes America in grim, bleak terms, have ranged from accurately citing statistics showing homicide increases in cities to blanket, untrue assertions that\u00a0crime is at unprecedented levels.\u00a0The Brennan Center, in its analysis last week, said there is no proof of a nationwide crime wave.In fact, the Brennan Center downplayed the results of its analysis to support its criminal-leniency policies and sentencing rewrites at the federal level. From 2014 to 2016, using data collected from police departments in the 30 largest U.S. cities, the Center projected murders would increase 31.5 percent\u00a0within 24 months.Reuters\u00a0looked for possible good news: \u201cViolent crime in U.S. rose in 2015 but far from peak levels: FBI\u201d Coming on the day of the first debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the report could \u201cbe turned into political football,\u201d said Robert Smith, a research fellow at Harvard Law School\u2026Trump last week praised aggressive policing, including \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d tactics that critics say unfairly target minorities.The Guardian wrung its hands over Trump\u2019s possible political gain from public worries about rising crime, after leading with\u00a0\u201cMurders up 10.8% in biggest percentage increase since 1971, FBI data shows.\u201dTrump has blamed Obama and his administration for a \u201crollback of criminal enforcement\u201d that has made the country less safe\u2026Trump and other politicians, [executive director of Color of Change Rashad Robinson] said, \u201chave started us down a path to undo long-fought gains in criminal justice reform, and we should not let the positive momentum be derailed by a lack of facts, by fear, by racism and by demagoguery.\u201dThe Daily Beast reported: \u201cViolent Crime Is Up, but Donald Trump Is Still Wrong\u201dTrump\u2014who calls himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate\u2014has been stepping up his efforts to use the crime issue to supposedly appeal to African American voters and definitely stoke fears among his white working class base\u2026By any measure violent crime in the U.S. is near historic lows and the country is dramatically safer than it was a quarter century ago. Homicide and other violent crime are at about half of what they were at their peak in 1991. Gun homicides have dropped by about 40 percent since 1993\u2026Nevertheless, Trump has been pouncing on crime and its racial contours to paint himself as a friend to minority communities, but thanks to tired strategies or bad optics that message has so far failed to land.According to The Huffington Post,\u00a0\u201c2015 Was One Of The Safest Years In The Past 2 Decades, According To FBI Crime Stats\u201d2015 was safer than any year during the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. Looking back at trends over the past five and 10 years, the total number of violent crimes in 2015 was 0.7 percent below the 2011 level and 16.5 percent below the 2006 level. Nevertheless, in a\u00a0poll\u00a0conducted earlier this year by The Huffington Post and YouGov, most Americans incorrectly believed that crime had risen overall in the past 10 years.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has declared\u00a0himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, is widely expected to seize on the statistical uptick in the homicide numbers ahead of the first presidential debate on Monday night.The FBI also found that after Obama\u2019s\u00a0\u201cstigmatize-and-federalize\u201d\u00a0campaign against local and state law enforcement began, crime began to rise:Many Americans are\u00a0worrying a great deal about crime afflicting their communities:The\u00a0Gallup poll discovered that 53 percent of respondents say they now \u201cworry a great deal\u201d about rising rates of crime and violence. That is a rapid rise \u2014 in 2014, \u00a0just 39 percent were worried a\u201d great deal\u201d as they are today.Concern among swing-voting independents rose from 36 percent to 53 percent. Among Republicans, the \u201cgreat deal\u201d number rose 15 points up to 53 percent, bringing it level with the 52 percent concern among Democrats.Seventy percent of people with just high-school degrees \u2014 but only 32 percent of people with college degrees \u2014 said they were worried a great deal about crime. Those two numbers have risen by 20 points and 1 point, respectively, since 2014.Concern among middle-income people has risen by 20 points since 2014, up to 57 percent. Among upper-income people, concern has apparently risen by only eight points, to merely 36 percent.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Law Enforcement, Crime, Donald TrumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The story claims \u201cthe Mercers played a role behind the scenes encouraging a detente.\u201dIn a statement to the Washington Post, the Mercers signaled support for Cruz\u2019s decision and explained why they believe this election is so critical:For the first time in many decades, American voters have the chance to turn their backs on the political elite, an elite both Democrat and Republican, that has chosen as its leader Hillary Clinton, a dedicated foe of both the First and Second Amendments and the most dishonest, corrupt, and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency. Even such great Americans as Mitt Romney and George Bush have stooped to endorse Mrs. Clinton rather than risk electing a president who follows the will of the people. We have long supported Senator Ted Cruz. He has waged a fearless battle against the elite throughout his career. We are delighted that he is joining us and a growing army of Americans in support of Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy for the presidency of the United States of America.Following the statement, the Post included this parenthetical fact-check:(Neither Romney nor either of the Bush presidents \u2014 George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush \u2014 has endorsed Clinton. A family friend said George H.W. Bush plans to vote for Clinton, but his aides have not publicly confirmed that.)The Post, which is owned by globalist tech billionaire Jeff Bezos, felt it necessary to declare\u00a0that neither the Bushes nor Romney have formally\u00a0\u201cendorsed\u201d Hillary Clinton. This is a defensive posture by the Post and a dishonest one at that.Mitt Romney has actively fought Donald Trump, starting with staging\u00a0a widely publicized comeback speech specifically to attack Donald Trump. If only he had opposed\u00a0Barack Obama with the same vigor!\u00a0The 2012 GOP\u00a0nominee\u00a0has also actively encouraged third-partiers to campaign against Trump, mocked Trump\u2019s family, and held a \u201cNeverTrump gathering,\u201d to name a few things.The last two Republican presidents have been conspicuously absent from the national dialogue during this election cycle, with the exception of the prominent rumor that George H.W. Bush will be voting for Hillary Clinton. His aides have not publicly denied it.It\u2019s obvious to any observer of American politics with common sense that for past presidents and nominees of the Republican Party to not support the GOP\u2019s chosen candidate is tantamount to endorsing Hillary Clinton. Only the smug, deluded, and\u00a0left-wing disagree with this.But no one accused the establishment of having common sense.While Romney, the Bushes, and the media play word games, the Executive and Judicial\u00a0Branches hang in the balance.What is perhaps most noteworthy about the article is not what the \u201cBezos Post\u201d chose to fact-check, it\u2019s what they chose not\u00a0to fact-check. The Mercers state unequivocally that Hillary Clinton is \u201ca dedicated foe of both the First and Second Amendments and the most dishonest, corrupt, and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency.\u201dSo, not only is Clinton\u00a0the least qualified candidate ever to seek the highest office in the land, but she is also, according to the statement, anti-U.S. Constitution.These claims did not merit a Washington Post footnote (differing on the semantics of the word \u201cendorsement\u201d did).Thus, by employing the Post\u2019s own standard of when to include a clarifying parenthetical, it is\u00a0safe to assume they affirm the fact that Hillary Clinton is \u201cthe most dishonest, corrupt, and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency.\u201dWe couldn\u2019t agree more.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Fact Check, Hillary Clinton, Jeff Bezos, Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Ted Cruz, Washington PostComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I get his pitch: by amplifying divisive rhetoric to socially intolerable and upsetting levels, he\u2019s supposedly exposing an unflattering subcurrent of whiny, righteous pomposity that resides somewhere in the progressive left.But I had a hard time looking out on that packed house last night and believing all those members of the University community, vehemently applauding the public degradation of plus-sized women, were in on the joke.I value free speech as much as the next college newspaper editor. I never questioned Yiannopoulos\u2019 right to speak on campus, nor Students for Trump\u2019s right to invite him.But I am beginning to question the standards by which we judge performers who occupy our University\u2019s main stage. How hateful must a performer\u2019s rhetoric be for the University to at least speak out against it?A number of students at the Yiannopoulos event said the Daily Reveille had been targeting the British conservative provocateur in the week before he came to the college campus.One student told Breitbart Texas that \u201cthe paper was full of\u201d anti-Yiannopoulos rhetoric leading up to Yiannopoulos\u2019 appearance.While garnering one his largest crowds yet on a college campus, LSU student protesters were nowhere to be found, despite planning their \u201cresponse\u201d to Yiannopoulos weeks beforehand, as Breitbart Texas reported.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

(Read below and notice the knives prodding that direction)\nAgain, disappointment doesn\u2019t begin to describe my feelings.America is an idea, not a country. When we discuss the destruction of our country, that is vastly different than the destruction of an idea.I fear the idea is already lost, due to the panic of losing ones comfort and country.There are many things that I believe that I will never say, but I shall never say the things I do not believe.Come what may.The founders meant it much differently when they said: join or die.Welcome to the big tent. GOP / DNC 2016 join or die.Long live the idea of the republic.In a follow-up Facebook post, Beck wrote: \u201cReading Comments. Facebook has become Chicago 1968. Nothing but firebombs, Hatred and vitriol. I think it is time to put social media away when almost\u00a0Every response you want to write is \u2018F$!* you.\u2019\u201dHe was perhaps referring to the most \u201cliked\u201d comment on his initial post about Cruz from a fan who wrote:What can I say\u2026.even Ted Cruz understands what is truly at stake here\u2026..I\u2019ve said it a thousand times\u2026..If Hillary wins, there will be NOTHING LEFT TO SAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What does Glenn not get about that, just because he now has millions upon millions and can survive on his own?\u2026..not all of us have that luxury Glenn, some of us have to work everyday, support our families and pay bills\u2026\u2026it gets harder every presidential term, Hillary would just drive it into the ground\u2026\u2026grow up, vote for a chance to save the country.In a third follow-up post, Beck\u2019s \u201cEditor\u201d wrote the following in his stead explaining Beck\u2019s phone conversation with Cruz:Editors note:Glenn spoke with Senator Ted Cruz early this afternoon by phone for about 40 minutes.Their conversation was described as private, respectful to each other\u2019s POV and pointed at times.Mr Beck stated immediately following the phone call:\u201cstanding alone doesn\u2019t mean you are wrong, it merely means you are standing alone. I have been here before. In someways it is how I built my career and it is certainly why I built Mercury Radio the way I did. To be free of all commercial, corporate and political ties so I am able to speak my mind even if the entire political and corporate world disagrees.\u201dDuring the call, Senator Cruz agreed that he needed to speak with Glenn\u2019s audience himself as many in his audience campaigned for the Senator during his run for President.While many who, view, listen, read and follow Mr Beck are now supporting the GOP candidate, many are voting their conscience by looking outside the party nominees.Senator Cruz will be on The Glenn Beck radio program Monday between 9am and 12n eastern.The exact time of the interview is yet to be determined by the Cruz camp and GBP producers.Glenn has much to say on this issue and to the Senator and will be addressing his personal views as soon as Monday on his national radio program which is seen and heard by 10 million Americans on over 400 stations nationwide, Sirius/XM and the Blaze TV.Beck, an ardent supporter of Cruz, campaigned tirelessly for the Texas Senator throughout the primary season, even to the detriment of his own business interests, as the increasingly strident tone of his support\u00a0for Cruz and denunciations of Trump reportedly alienated listeners and advertisers.He\u00a0often couched his enthusiasm for Cruz with a religious zeal, describing the Texan\u00a0as\u00a0\u201canointed\u201d by God\u00a0and \u201craised for these times\u201d as \u201cthe next George Washington.\u201d\u00a0At key moments in the primary, he\u00a0urged his listeners to fast and pray for Cruz\u2019s victory.But as Trump\u2019s momentum continued, Beck expressed harsh criticism for the Evangelical Christians who threw their support to Cruz\u2019s opponent, declaring at one point that \u201creal Christians\u201d don\u2019t support Donald Trump\u00a0and that \u201call throughout the South the Evangelicals are not listening to their God\u201d because Cruz lost the Southern primaries to Trump.The fervor of Beck\u2019s support for Cruz has been matched only by the vehemence of his\u00a0opposition to Trump, whom he regularly compares to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. He\u00a0has called the New York real estate mogul \u00a0\u201ca pathological narcissistic sociopath\u201d\u00a0and \u201ca narcissistic psychopath\u201d\u00a0whose presidency \u201cwill lead to civil war or worst.\u201dBeck even\u00a0turned his ire on\u00a0Trump voters. After the Nevada caucus, he\u00a0called Trump supporters \u201cbrown shirts\u201d\u00a0in reference to the infamous Nazi paramilitary group. Last year, he accused Trump\u2019s\u00a0Tea Party supporters of being racist\u00a0for opposing President Obama while supporting Trump, who\u00a0Beck considers\u00a0to be a\u00a0leftwing progressive\u00a0like Obama.The former radio shock jock\u2019s\u00a0disdain for Trump reached a crescendo in April when he donned swim goggles and\u00a0rubbed his face in a bowl of crushed Cheetos\u00a0to see if he could \u201clook like Donald Trump.\u201dFollow Rebecca Mansour on Twitter\u00a0@RAMansour2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Glenn Beck, Ted CruzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It could have been an exploding Edible Arrangement.Even after the dumbest mammal in North America, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, had admitted it was a bomb, journalists were indignant that Trump had called a bomb a \u201cbomb\u201d before they said so.On CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d on Sunday, The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman said that even Trump\u2019s supporters worry that \u201che often gets ahead of information\u201d and that Democrats would make it an issue of his not being \u201ccareful, that he doesn\u2019t wait for facts.

None of us ever worry about Trump \u201cgetting ahead of the facts.\u201dCNN\u2019s Sara Murray complained that Trump \u201cseizes on these moments so instantly before we have the facts.\u201dInstead of instantly seizing on this moment to assume Trump was wrong, shouldn\u2019t Sara have waited until all the facts were in?On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Ruth Marcus announced, \u201cI\u2019m a facts girl\u201d \u2014 thanks for sharing your OKCupid profile with us, Ruth! \u2014 \u201cso I think the response, \u2018I\u2019d like to wait for the facts until I comment,\u2019 is always a good idea.\u201dThe media was enraged that Trump was sensible enough to realize what had happened. HE COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG! Yeah, but he wasn\u2019t. As Trump said, \u201cI should be a newscaster because I called it before the news.\u201dBy Monday morning, Hillary was doing PR work for Islam, calling the culprits \u201cbad guys,\u201d but stressing that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to go after an entire religion.\u201d No one had suggested \u201cgoing after an entire religion,\u201d but I guess you can never be too careful when dealing with all those deplorable, irredeemable Americans.A few hours later, New Jersey police caught the suspect, an Irish Catholic altar boy from Teaneck named Seamus Patrick O\u2019Sullivan. Just kidding! He was an immigrant from Afghanistan named Ahmad Khan Rahami.This is the doubletalk the public has been forced to endure after every terrorist attack.As described in\u00a0In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!\u00a0our media and politicians are pretty quick to jump to the conclusion that terrorist attacks have absolutely nothing to do with Islam.The night a truck bomb was found smoldering in Times Square, Mayor Michael Bloomberg went on \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d and said he thought it was somebody \u201chomegrown,\u201d maybe \u201csomebody with a political agenda that doesn\u2019t like the health care bill or something.\u201dThe morning after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, NBC\u2019s law enforcement analyst, Jim Cavanaugh, said that his best guess was that the shooter was a person \u201crooted in white hate movements,\u201d and had picked the club \u201cbecause it\u2019s a diverse club and he hates diverse people.\u201d(By which I think he means yours truly! I have the perfect alibi, of course. If I ever found myself in a gay nightclub, I\u2019d be too busy signing autographs to shoot anybody.)The fact that the shooter was a second-generation Muslim immigrant named Omar Mateen, who had repeatedly pledged his allegiance to ISIS during the attack, was treated by our media as one of many strands of evidence, not nearly as important as the possibility that Mateen might be gay and had been scarred by America\u2019s endemic homophobia.After the 2009 Fort Hood attack by a Major Nidal Hasan yelling, \u201cAllahu Akbar!\u201d Obama warned Americans not to \u201cjump to conclusions.\u201d (Deplorable, irredeemable Americans are always jumping to unwarranted conclusions!)He proceeded to label the jihadist attack an act of \u201cworkplace violence.\u201d To Obama\u2019s credit, his policies have reduced workplace violence considerably by putting so many Americans out of work.The media and Obama administration officials took weeks to settle on a motive for the San Bernardino terrorists, despite their having pledged allegiance to ISIS while committing the attack. That night, the Los Angeles Times falsely reported that an office dispute had preceded the slaughter. The Times won a Pulitzer for the reporting that included this intentional misdirection.The left has apparently decided that white America is a declining demographic and they are going to treat Muslim grievance groups like NARAL:\u00a0We are with you on everything.\u00a0It\u2019s probably just a coincidence that Muslim immigrants are advantageous to the Democrats\u2019 electoral prospects.Even the terrorists have been getting impatient with the American left\u2019s refusal to give them due credit. Major Hasan\u2019s spiritual adviser, Anwar al-Awlaki, denounced the Obama administration for denying that the Fort Hood shooting was a glorious act of Islamic terrorism. After Orlando, al-Qaida\u2019s in-house magazine, Inspire, ordered jihadists in America to concentrate on killing Anglo-Saxon Americans to avoid confusing the U.S. media.When American settlers sent scouts to ride ahead and look for Indians, if the scouts returned saying there were 6,000 Sioux on the other side of the ridge, no one cared about their horsemanship or the language they used.Trump is the only politician in 50 years to say, \u201cImmigration security is national security.\u201d The media won\u2019t listen. But the voters are listening.COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER\u00a0\nDISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, National Security, Ahmad Khan Rahami, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, terrorismComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In contrast, 95 percent of the segments either dismissed concerns outright or merely relayed the Clinton camp\u2019s press releases, without giving the other side of the story.The 62 stories began in the aftermath of the August 9 release of the results of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation by Washington watchdog group Judicial Watch.The group\u2019s findings revealed that the Clintons failed to report serious conflicts of interest. The findings, along with other facts\u00a0revealed in the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d have spurred much skeptical media coverage of the foundation.But the MRC survey of network coverage revealed only three stories between August 9 and today, in which the established networks included any warnings about the Clintons\u2019 conflict of interest issued by numerous sources, or mention how\u00a0even many on the left now believe the Clintons should shut down the Clinton Foundation, especially during Hillary\u2019s run for president.During the same period of time, many other media outlets had been publishing or airing stories highlighting the problematic actions the Clintons took with their purported charity.A host of media outlets have now called for the Clinton Foundation to be shut down, including the far left Minneapolis Star Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle, and\u00a0The New York Times. Other outlets such as Huffington Post, Slate and the Daily Beast have also made the call for the foundation to be shuttered to avoid further conflict of interest charges.The worries on the left were so deep that the Democrat National Committee had produced a 42-page memo to guide party members on how to treat Hillary\u2019s \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d over the allegations of her pay-to-play scandals.Even this week it was found that fully 194 Clinton Foundation donors received appointments to State Department positions while Hillary was Obama\u2019s Secretary of State.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, ABC, CBS, Clinton Cash, Clinton Foundation, Hillary Clinton, Media Bias, NBCComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He spent Mercury\u2019s money developing films, planning amusement parks, and planning to reinvent the healthcare industry starting by building his own hospitals. In the summer of 2013, Beck even produced a live stage show called \u2018Man in the Moon\u2019 that cost over $2 million for a single night run.\u201dThe lawsuit continues: \u201cBeck also became suspicious of almost everyone. He began terminating employees, including those who had been with the company for more than a decade. Balfe navigated these terminations for Beck at his request, working hard to ensure that they did not result in the release of information that was embarrassing and potentially devastating for Beck\u2019s brand.\u201d[\u2026]The narrative continues: \u201cBy 2014, Mercury faced immense cash pressures as services continued to decline, ad sales lagged, and deals fell through. Balfe watched as Beck\u2019s erratic behavior devastated the company Balfe had spent his entire career building. In an effort to save Mercury from the mounting financial pressure, Balfe even agreed to defer his own compensation\u2014essentially providing an interest-free loan to Mercury. Balfe deferred his compensation based on the understanding that he would be paid as soon as Mercury was less stressed by the mounting cash pressures. By the time Balfe was terminated in December 2014, Mercury owed him approximately $1.68 million in deferred compensation.\u201cAs Beck\u2019s paranoia increased, so did his spending. The company was spending excessive amounts to pay for unnecessary private security Beck required, and Beck insisted on leasing unnecessary office space as well as building and rebuilding himself unnecessary offices and sets. Despite Balfe\u2019s best efforts, Mercury soon fell behind on vendor payments.\u201dRead the rest here.

That report stated that, each year, the risk to an American of being killed by a refugee in a terror attack is 1 in 3.64 billion, as Huffington Post\u2019s Elise Foley noted on Twitter. From the report:From 1975 through 2015, the annual chance that an American would be murdered in a terrorist attack carried out by a foreign-born terrorist was 1 in 3,609,709. Foreigners on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) killed zero Americans in terrorist attacks, whereas those on other tourist visas killed 1 in 3.9 million a year. The chance that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year.In other words, for every 10.92 billion years that Americans live \u2014 one Skittle, if you will \u2014 refugees will kill an American in a terror attack in three.An actual Skittle is about 1 centimeter squared by about a half a centimeter tall (or thereabouts). Setting aside questions of stacking the oblong Skittles in this very large bowl by assuming each will occupy two-thirds of that volume, we\u2019re talking about one-and-a-half Olympic swimming pools of Skittles. Wrigley produces 200 million Skittles a day, so this is the entire production line for more than 54 days, transported to an oversized swimming pool and dumped in to the top. And in that pool: Three poison Skittles.\u2026If there is one poisoned Skittle in 3.64 billion, that means I could extract quite a few handfuls before I was likely to pick out a poisoned one.Specifically, about 68.7 million handfuls. Let\u2019s say it takes me one minute to grab a handful and eat them. I would hit a poisoned Skittle, on average, every 130 years. I would also be consuming the equivalent of a package of Skittles every minute, which is about 330,000 calories a day.Yet\u00a0he throws in a caveat: \u201chow many handfuls could I grab before I got one that\u2019s poisoned?\u00a0Well, it could be one, of course.\u201dIndeed, it could be. And there could have been a jihadist refugee who attacked nine strangers with a knife \u2014 just this past weekend. And Bump is, apparently, so consumed by\u00a0Skittles that he has ignored\u00a0this fact.The column includes nothing about Dahir Adan, a \u201cmember of Minnesota\u2019s Somali refugee community,\u201d who eyewitnesses say shouted about Allah and asked people whether they were Muslim as he rampaged through Crossroads Mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota.Per Bump, murder by refugees is so scarce that these Minnesotans\u2019\u00a0wounds are statistically insignificant.

I\u2019m done, I\u2019m pissed, and I\u2019m not putting up with it anymore! Let me tell you something, you filthy traitors in the government, you pieces of crap.You are the most degenerate, twisted, mentally ill people I\u2019ve ever seen, wanting to gang-rape this Republic and this country and the West that has been the literal cornerstone, the absolute jewel in the crown of free Western Renaissance societies and the very best literature, music, technology, science, medicine, culture the world\u2019s ever seen!You Satanists want to sacrifice the West! You want to kill the beautiful goddess that is the West! You people are enemies, and we\u2019re going to get your asses, and we know what you\u2019re up to, and we\u2019re coming for you!As a parting salvo, he said:Let me tell all the scum and all the leftists: you\u2019re going to lose all of your jobs soon. The whole mainstream media is dying. We\u2019re going to be in a huge Depression. You\u2019re going to be living in your mothers\u2019 basements.And I hope your little fake liberal culture you\u2019ve got that\u2019s totally fascist and Satanic \u2014 I hope it keeps you warm at night because that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to have, and it\u2019s all you\u2019re ever going to have.

Would you take a handful?\u201d The image\u00a0then turned the point to the current crisis saying, \u201cThat\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201dThis image says it all.

Just as quickly, the media joined in the attack, fact checking a Twitter and Instagram meme from a private citizen. The Hollywood Reporter received a statement from\u00a0an executive at Wrigley\u00a0\u2014 the candy\u2019s maker \u2014\u00a0saying, \u201cSkittles are candy. Refugees are people.\u201d Wrigley\u2019s parent company, Mars, Inc., shared the sentiment on Twitter, as well.pic.twitter.com/VUwYKzqujc\u2014 Mars, Incorporated (@MarsGlobal) September 20, 2016But this idea was far from scandalous\u00a0in 2014 when the feminist left\u00a0used this same analogy\u00a0in a very similar context.Using the chocolate candy M&Ms instead of Skittles, the social campaign dubbed #YesAllWomen used the exact same analogy to\u00a0whip up sympathy for women \u2014 that their interactions with men are always dangerous because of the few who are abusers or rapists.A common\u00a0#YesAllWomen\u00a0meme\u00a0posted to Twitter, YouTube, and other social media platforms read: \u201cYou say not all men are monsters? Imagine a bowl of M&Ms. 10% of them are poisoned. Go Ahead. Eat a handful. Not all M&Ms are poison!\u201d#NotAllMen? Imagine a bowl of M&Ms, 10% are poisoned. Go ahead, eat a handful. Not all M&Ms are poison. #YesAllWomen pic.twitter.com/6VFMxWdhuf\u2014 Janina Sj\u00f6holm (@RowanLake99) May 28, 2014The argument even found approving coverage at Slate, which \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 went after Trump hard. Author Phil Plait sandwiches the M&M meme between two paragraphs that could be easily adapted to the refugee debate of 2016.The discussion isn\u2019t about the men who aren\u2019t a problem\u2026\u00a0when a woman is walking down the street, or on a blind date, or, yes, in an elevator alone, she doesn\u2019t know which group you\u2019re in. You might be the potential best guy ever in the history of history, but there\u2019s no way for her to know that. A fraction of men out there are most definitely\u00a0not in that group. Which are you? Inside your head you know, but outside your head it\u2019s impossible to.And some left-wing bloggers seem to be picking up on this trouble with their narrative. The feminist site Bustle tried to get ahead of the #YesAllWomen-Trump comparisons on Tuesday, pushing some revisionist history about the meme \u2014 that it was always flawed (even though nobody on the left said so two years ago).The Skittles meme message has been used before on multiple occasions, meaning you can only blame Trump Jr. for its distribution, not its inception. However, even with the benefit of hindsight, Trump Jr. and the campaign did little to improve upon the underlying statistical and rhetorical assumptions in the argument, which remain both inaccurate and morally bankrupt.This is\u00a0just another example of situational logic and moral standards from the political left. Any particular narrative tool is perfectly legitimate if they want to use it, but the moment the right does, it is time for an all-out attack.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Social Justice, Donald Trump Jr., feminism, liberals, M&Ms, rape culture, SkittlesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Author Tom McCarthy adds: \u201cThe Breitbart story [sic: it is an op-ed], a tourist\u2019s out-of-nowhere description of a made-up gang-rape epidemic in Europe, is not only openly, wildy racist, describing a continental crisis of white European women under assault by \u201cMiddle Eastern-looking men\u201d \u2013 the racist Breitbart piece is also breathtakingly unhinged from reality\u201d.How the Guardian attacked a sex assault victimMs. Waters\u2019s article, entitled \u201cEurope\u2019s Rape Epidemic: Western Women Will Be Sacrificed At The Altar Of Mass Migration\u201d details Ms. Waters\u2019s own experiences with sexually aggressive migrants, as well as using statistics from Norway, Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom to prove her article\u2019s premise.Regardless, the Guardian, as well as Talking Points Memo and POLITICO have described her work, published by me (Raheem Kassam) on Breitbart London, as \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d.When asked to apologise, author Tom McCarthy responded: \u201cI\u2019ve had my editors review the post and we\u2019re going to let it stand\u201d.Donald Trump Jr. is tweeting straight-up white nationalist propaganda now https://t.co/WLcdjFI7tr pic.twitter.com/Fyfe1qfJbW\u2014 Talking Points Memo (@TPM) September 20, 2016Lumping into the discussion, POLITIO\u2019s Ben White urged Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager revoke his son\u2019s Twitter access after linking to the article:. @KellyannePolls better get her hands on Don Jr's phone. https://t.co/MONZ7joJiq\u2014 Ben White (@morningmoneyben) September 20, 2016When challenged on his denial of Europe\u2019s rape epidemic, White simply replied, \u201cCharming\u201d.The Guardian\u2019s UK outlet, which also serves as the HQ for the group, has written extensively on the Rotherham rape scandal which saw at least 1,400, predominantly white, working class girls groomed and raped by mostly Pakistani, Muslim men.One headline on the Guardian from February 2016 reads: \u201cChild sex abuse in Rotherham: \u2018I was treated as a criminal \u2026 never as a victim'\u201d \u2013 the same approach the Guardian U.S. has sought to take with Anne Marie Waters, today.The Cologne sexual assault and rape scandal, broken by Breitbart London, described the scenes as around 1,000 migrants sexually harrassed, assaulted, and raped German women at the train station in the German city on New Year\u2019s Eve 2015.In Ms. Waters\u2019s article, she tells of how she was repeatedly targeted for sex by migrant men who refused to accept her rejections.

Our local police \u2014 they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don\u2019t want to be accused of profiling\u00a0and they don\u2019t want to be accused of all sorts of things.\u00a0You know, in Israel they profile. They\u2019ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do. But Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they\u2019ll profile. They see somebody that\u2019s suspicious, they will profile. They will take that person and they\u2019ll check out. Do we have a choice? Look what\u2019s going on. Do we really have a choice? We\u2019re trying to be so politically correct in our country. And this is only going to get worse.Note that Trump never once used the term \u201cracial.\u201d The quote was reported by several Israeli news outlets\u00a0without further comment, and without the word \u201cracial,\u201d because he\u00a0accurately described certain Israeli practices\u00a0\u2014 such as screening people in airport security lines, for example, where officials will ask passengers questions about their communities, their education, and their religion, often going into considerable detail to determine whether any individual poses a likely security risk.The American left argues that such practices amount to racial profiling, and are hence racist, but these practices have nothing to do with race.In December, following the San Bernardino Islamic terror attack, a neighbor who noticed suspicious activity at the terrorists\u2019 home said he had wanted to report them to authorities but was afraid of being accused of racial profiling.The Hill noted Wednesday that CNN had falsely added the word \u201cracial\u201d to Trump\u2019s comments on profiling to prevent terror. Other outlets, including the avowedly left-wing Mother Jones and\u00a0Rolling Stone, had also picked up the false \u201cTrump calls for racial profiling\u201d meme.

Iran cannot talk about fighting extremism while its leaders, Quds Force and Revolutionary Guard continue to fund, train, arm and facilitate acts of terrorism.Moreover, he accuses Iran of providing sanctuary to high-ranking al-Qaeda members, including\u00a0\u201cOsama bin Laden\u2019s son, Saad, and al Qaeda\u2019s chief of operations, Saif al-Adel, along with numerous other operatives guilty of attacks against Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and other targets.\u201dSaudi Arabia has been accused of being involved in the 9/11 attacks against the U.S. homeland.Meanwhile, Iran is accused of collaborating with Sunni groups and 9/11 conspirators al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, arguing that their hate towards the United States brings them together.Jubeir notes that one of the \u201cprincipal slogans\u201d of Iran remains \u201cDeath to America!\u201dHe adds:Iran could also stop funding terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah\u2026 Iran could stop producing and distributing improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, which have killed or injured thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. And Iran could halt supplying weapons to terrorists and sectarian militias in the region who seek to replace legitimate governments with Iranian puppets\u2026Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic accuse each other of spreading their respective ideologies across the world.The Saudi official argues:[Following the 1979 revolution] Mullahs seized power and vowed\u2014as written in their constitution\u2014to export the revolution and spread their ideology through religious and sectarian conflict.To export the revolution, Iran set up so-called Cultural Centers of the Revolutionary Guard in many countries, including Sudan, Nigeria, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Comoros Islands. The aim was to spread their ideology through propaganda and violence.Iran\u2019s FM points out:Over the past three decades, Riyadh has spent tens of billions of dollars exporting Wahhabism through thousands of mosques and madrasas across the world. From Asia to Africa, from Europe to the Americas, this theological perversion has wrought havoc.Big Journalism, Middle East, National Security, Iran, Iranian Islamic Revolution, Khomeinism, Saudi Arabia, Shiite, Sunni, united states, WahhabismComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Last week, contributor William Hicks posted a piece sarcastically calling pop stars Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj white supremacists for spreading Pepes on their social media accounts.This article was likely pushing back on the political left\u2019s claim that Donald Trump\u2019s son is a racist for posting a Pepe on his Instagram. Mensch is now putting the full force of her editorial authority behind that left-wing\u00a0narrative.\u201cPepe is a cartoon frog who began his Internet life as an innocent meme enjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike. But in recent months, Pepe\u2019s been almost entirely co-opted by the white supremacists who call themselves the \u2018alt-right,\u2019\u201d wrote Elizabeth Chan on behalf of the Clinton campaign last week, in an explainer that\u00a0attempted to link the Internet meme with white supremacy.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve decided to take back Pepe by adding swastikas and other symbols of anti-semitism and white supremacy.\u201dThe explainer based its comments largely on a Daily Beast interview with notorious troll and self-proclaimed parody account, Jared Taylor Swift, who made satirical comments about reclaiming Pepe \u201cfrom the normies.\u201d Swift and a fellow troll, \u201cPaul Town,\u201d later told the Daily Caller that they gave the Daily Beast\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi the most ridiculous quotes they could think of \u2014 and she printed them, falling entirely for the troll. With no\u00a0evidence but Nuzzi\u2019s discredited piece, mainstream media reporters have uncritically declared the frog to be an\u00a0icon for white nationalism on air, including NBC\u2019s Katy Tur and ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.Mensch fails to state that the creator of Pepe the Frog, Matt Furie, is actually a Democrat who expressed support for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, after his favorite candidate, Bernie Sanders, dropped out of the race.\u201cIt\u2019s weird that people are saying he\u2019s been \u2018a longtime white supremacist meme,\u2019\u201d said Furie, who denied that his frog had anything to do with white supremacy. \u201cIf anything he\u2019d be part of the Green party. He\u2019s a frog, why would he support white supremacists? That doesn\u2019t make any\u00a0sense.\u201dBut she doesn\u2019t need to analyze or even acknowledge any of that information. She has a folder with 12 Nazi Pepes in it, and that is enough for her to shut down any other interpretation.Charlie Nash is a reporter\u00a0for\u00a0Breitbart Tech.

Nearly 3 Years After Launch", "id": "post-5063952", "content": "by Raheem Kassam19 Sep 20160One major problem for author Sam Kriss is that Breitbart London\u2019s launch predates his article by nearly three years, and was recently described by fellow Remainiac\u00a0paper the Financial Times as being bigger (in the UK alone) than Sam\u2019s own regular parish: Vice UK.How Sam Kriss f*cked it all upI\u2019m actually really disappointed. I love hit pieces. Especially when they\u2019re about me. But Mr. Kriss has basically written a fantasy article based on what he wishes, rather than what\u2019s true. To him, no doubt, the truth would be a LOT, LOT worse. So it\u2019s a shame he didn\u2019t bother doing any proper research.To his credit, Mr. Kriss replied to my e-mail on the matter, and admitted: \u201cYou have indeed caught me out, that was a glaring factual error. Part of the job of any media organisation is to watch out for inaccuracies from its competitors; the more each of us do it, the better we can all be, and I thank you for your sterling work improving the image of our entire industry\u201d.He was obviously prompted by his embarrassed editor, Matt Kelly, who\u00a0failed in an attempt at a Twitter spat with yours truly last week. Mr. Kelly revels in New York Times articles about his newspaper which sells fewer copies every week (40,000-ish) than I reach with a single tweet sent in the middle of the night.Ho hum.Mr. Kriss\u2019s article begins by describing Breitbart News as \u201clong the house journal of the American alt-right\u201d failing to note:But Sam won\u2019t let facts stand in the way, he continues: \u201cBreitbart\u2019s website in the US is home to Milo Yiannopoulos, booted off Twitter for trolling, and Ann Coulter\u2026\u201d. Yes, except, no:Let\u2019s keep going. We\u2019re only ONE PARAGRAPH IN, PEOPLE!Sam Kriss continues: \u201cIn London it happily tracks supposed crimes by immigrants.\u201d\u201c\u2026the site\u2019s founder and namesake, Andrew Breitbart, would have never allowed this,\u201d Mr. Kriss writes, talking about some fantastical, shock troop-dystopian, alt-right future he has concocted in his own head for the sake of filling up a column in the Remoaner rag.It is unlikely he knew Andrew Breitbart, in order to make that claim. But even if he did: Breitbart News is still run by Andrew\u2019s best friends, confidantes, family members, and primary staff. Given Mr. Kriss\u2019s penchant for the absurd, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have based most of his research for this piece on a Ouija board session, but channel Andrew Breitbart he did not.This is all quite unsurprising, given that Mr. Kriss\u2019s life\u2019s work appears to culminate in being a self-hating Jew tweeting psychotically at the Israel military, as well as writing extensively about how it feels to be cuckolded.In response to my questions to him on the matter of the destruction of the State of Israel, Mr. Kriss replied: \u201cYes. I support the destruction of all states, but as an Israeli national I think I\u2019m entirely within my rights to call for Israel\u2019s destruction as a matter of urgency. I would add, as if this needs explication, that the state and the population are distinct entities\u201d.#celebratefreedom @IDFSpokesperson pic.twitter.com/PG5bWGTfDU\u2014 Sam Kriss \ud83d\udc2b (@sam_kriss) April 22, 2016Maybe I\u2019m being unfair, but Mr. Kriss\u2019s work has been described\u00a0as a \u201cgrossly unappetizing word salad\u201d and I couldn\u2019t have put it better myself.A master of projection indeed, he seems happiest when name-dropping Kierkegaard, Fanon, Marx, or Freud. My favourite line from his rant about how British schools are secretly white supremacist hubs reads: \u201cPrivate schools encourage a culture of snobbery and contempt far more destructive than any chimerical Salafist plot\u2026\u201dDid you read that? Eton is a bigger threat to the world than ISIS.Mind you, from a writer who feels the need to quote Heidegger in a tedious fulmination about Pokemon Go!, this is hardly a shock.Mr. Kriss concludes for the New European that Nigel Farage and Katie Hopkins were part of the launch of Breitbart London: not true, and calls our editorial position on Islam in Europe \u201ckookery\u201d.I can agree with him, however, on one point: Whenever the establishment political parties are trying to fudge the immigration debate, \u201c\u2026Breitbart is there, doing the only work it knows how to do\u201d.Hear, hear\u2026(P.S. Heidegger, Marx, Fanon, Kierkegaard, and Freud. There, now Mr. Kriss will feel more comfortable having read this. He even invoked Marx in his e-mail responses to me, most of which were attempts to be funny, but not witty or insightful enough to be published on these pages).LISTEN TO ME ADDRESS THE ARTICLE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:\u00a0Big Journalism, Breitbart London, Breitbart News, sam kriss, the new europeanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He\u2019s being criticized for talking about the New York bomb before local officials or local law enforcement had a chance to do so. He told the Colorado Springs crowd that \u201ca bomb went off in New York, and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s really just a few minutes after the incident. And his opponent tried to draw a contrast. She waited hours later, until local officials spoke, and then she said this:Clinton (clip):\u00a0I think it\u2019s important to know the facts about any incident like this. I think it\u2019s always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions.Tapper:\u00a0As a general note, do you think politicians should wait until more information comes in, and should they defer to local official and investigators? Isn\u2019t that what you do as the governor of New Jersey?Tapper made no mention of Clinton\u2019s similar remark.Here is the full, relevant exchange\u00a0between Clinton and reporters on Saturday night, via Liz Kreutz of ABC News and other sources:Clinton:\u00a0I\u2019ve breen briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey, and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously, we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, also to pray for the victims. We have to let this investigation unfold. We\u2019ve been in touch with various officials, including the mayor\u2019s office in New York, to learn what they are discovering as they conduct this investigation. And I\u2019ll have more to say about it when we actually know the facts?Reporter:\u00a0Secretary Clinton,\u00a0Do you have any reaction to the fact that Donald Trump, immediately upon taking the stage tonight, called the explosion in New York a \u201cbomb\u201d \u2026 ?Clinton:\u00a0Well, I think it\u2019s important to know the facts about any incident like this. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it, trying to determine what did happen.\u00a0I think it\u2019s always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened.Ironically, later in the program, while introducing Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Tapper played the full clip, including Clinton\u2019s use of the word \u201cbombings.\u201d Tapper did not ask Kaine about whether Clinton\u2019s remark was appropriate.For the record, Christie\u2019s response to Tapper\u2019s question defended Trump without referring to Clinton\u2019s statement.Christie: Well, listen, I don\u2019t think you have to defer when saying there was an explosion and a bomb in New York. I mean, everybody knew that. It was being reported in television, Jake, so there\u2019s a difference. Now, you shouldn\u2019t attribute it to any particular organization or group if you don\u2019t have the facts or information to do that. But I think that what Donald did was perfectly appropriate to tell that group in Colorado Springs a bomb exploded. This is typical of Mrs. Clinton. She has absolutely no basis to be critical of what he did yesterday \u2026Tapper was not all smiles for Kaine: he questioned the Democratic vice presidential nominee aggressively about Hillary Clinton\u2019s close confident Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s alleged role in pushing the Birther conspiracy theory in 2008.Joel B.

Pinkerton17 Sep 20160Trump raised the stakes Friday night in Miami. As\u00a0Breitbart News\u00a0headlined,\u00a0\u201cTrump Makes Entrance to \u2018Do You Hear the People Sing?\u2019 with \u2018Les Deplorabl\u00e9s\u2019 Banner.\u201d The lyrics heard were these:Do you hear the people sing?Singing a song of angry men?It is the music of a peopleWho will not be slaves again!When the beating of your heartEchoes the beating of the drumsThere is a life about to startWhen tomorrow comes!Yes, indeed, it\u2019s a revolutionary situation. It\u2019s peaceful and democratic, to be sure, but, nonetheless, it\u2019s a revolution. Embracing this thrilling new spirit\u2014of the sort never seen, for example, during the McCain or Romney campaigns\u2014Trump opened his speech by nodding to the audience and quipping, \u201cWelcome, all of you deplorables.\u201dAnd while it might be a cliche to write, \u201cthe crowd went wild,\u201d that\u2019s exactly what happened. Without a doubt, Trump\u2019s use of \u201cdeplorables\u201d as a play on the musical\u00a0Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2014the source of the lyrics above and below\u2014is a first in US politics.A few other portals covered the \u201cdeplorables\u201d angle. The Drudge Report\u00a0played it big: \u201cMiami Trump frenzy.\u201d And here\u2019s how\u00a0Mediaite\u00a0put it: \u201c\u2018Les Deplorables\u2019: Trump Took the Stage in Miami in the Most Over-the-Top Way Possible.\u201d And\u00a0Business Insider:\u00a0\u201cTrump walks onstage to theme of \u2018Les Miserables,\u2019 greets \u2018deplorables\u2019 at his Miami rally.\u201d Fox News was on it, too. As reporter Garrett Tenney said on Saturday morning, \u201cThe \u2018deplorable\u201d label has become a badge of honor for Trump supporters.\u201dYet for the most part, the Main Stream Media studiously ignored the Miami event and all its heavy symbolism. Instead, the MSM had its own agenda, which we can sum up in two words:\u00a0Destroy Trump.To that end,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0used the word \u201clie\u201d twice on its front page. One \u201cnews\u201d story was headlined, \u201cTrump Clung to \u2018Birther\u2019 Lie for Years, and Still Isn\u2019t Apologetic.\u201d And an accompanying editorial was headlined, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Latest Birther Lie.\u201dFor its part,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0was only marginally more fair and balanced; the word \u201clie\u201d did not appear on its front page. Instead, the key word was \u201cfalse,\u201d as in, \u201cTrump admits Obama was born in US, falsely blames Clinton for rumors.\u201d Of course, the \u201cL\u201d word, \u201clie,\u201d was still there\u2014it was in a column inside: \u201cDonald Trump is a racist conspiracy theorist. Don\u2019t let him lie his way out of it.\u201dWe might pause to note here the direct admonition to the reader:\u00a0Don\u2019t let him lie his way out of it. To put that another way, the newspaper is saying,\u00a0Join with us. That is, join with us as we fight the counter-revolution that will squash the revolution.As an aside, we can think of one scene in the musical\u00a0Les Mis\u00a0in which the main counter-revolutionary, Inspector Javert, boasts of the coming fight, \u201cOne more day to revolution/ We will nip it in the bud! We\u2019ll be ready for these schoolboys/ They will wet themselves with blood!\u201d Yet as we can look around today, we can see that there are Inspector Javerts in every era.Meanwhile, most television was the same\u2014vehemently anti-Trump. We can let CNN\u2019s Dylan Byers tell his side of the story: Recalling the incident on Friday in which the Trump campaign inveigled TV reporters to spend 20 minutes covering military heroes as they endorsed Trump, Byers opined: \u201cIf those 20 minutes represented the worst of the media,\u00a0the next six hours\u00a0represented the best of it.\u201d [emphasis in original] That is, the best TV reporters spent six hours pummeling Trump. And yet, as we come to think about it, we can see it\u2019s been a lot more than six hours\u2014more like a year-and-a-half.Byers continued, cheerleading from his side of the barricade: \u201cImmediately\u00a0after Trump falsely claimed Hillary Clinton started the birtherism issue, and falsely claimed that he ended it, the media called him out.\u201d [emphasis in original]And then Byers added a kind of honor roll of CNN reporters who had lambasted Trump:John Berman:\u00a0\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign never, ever pushed the birther issue.\u201d \u2026Kate Bolduan:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump, from 2011, he made this his signature issue. No one has gone as far as Donald Trump on the birther issue.\u201d \u2026\u00a0John King: \u201c[Trump] did the country a great disservice by becoming the chief cheerleader for a fraud, a birther movement trying to\u00a0delegitimize\u00a0the sitting United States President.\u201d \u2026\u00a0Jake Tapper: \u201cThose are two factually false statements\u2026. [Hillary Clinton] and her campaign never started the birther issue. \u2026 Donald Trump did not end the birther issue.\u201dOkay, CNN, we get it: The Clinton News Network is still\u2026 the Clinton News Network.Yet all the propagandistic overkill aside, what can be said about the veracity of the Trumpian assertion that the Clintonites were a part of the \u201cbirther\u201d campaign against Barack Obama? After all, the truth should matter, right?If the truth does matter, that\u2019s a problem for CNN and the MSM. Because in fact, as\u00a0Breitbart\u00a0and\u00a0other outlets\u00a0have reported, back in 2007-8, the Clinton campaign\u00a0did\u00a0push the \u201cbirther\u201d issue.Admittedly, and proudly,\u00a0Breitbart\u00a0is a member in good standing of what Hillary Clinton might deride as \u201cthe vast deplorable conspiracy.\u201d Yet this September 16 headline from McClatchy New Service, a long-established outfit, speaks for itself:\u00a0\u201c2 Clinton supporters in \u201908 reportedly shared Obama \u2018birther\u2019 story.\u201d The piece, by McClatchy\u2019s David Goldstein, reports that back then, McClatchy even went so far as to send a reporter to Kenya.We might note that one of those Clinton operatives was Sidney Blumenthal. And Blumenthal, of course, has been a close adviser to both Bill and Hillary for decades; his e-mails, for example, are found all through the Benghazi investigation.Furthermore, conservative pundit\u00a0David Frum, no fan of Trump, tweeted out that the Hillary people had been even more deeply involved, starting at the top of the campaign. Frum recently cited an\u00a0incriminating memo, dated March 19, 2007, written by top Hillary campaign strategist Mark Penn; if you click on it, you will see a detailed plan for attacking Obama, including one whole section entitled, \u201cLack of American Roots.\u201d This nine-year-old memo, of course, has been just as available to the\u00a0Times\u00a0and the\u00a0Post\u00a0as to Frum and anyone else\u2014it\u2019s just that the MSM hasn\u2019t been interested.So we can see: The MSM, in its rush to dump on Trump, has gotten it wrong. Again. So it\u2019s little wonder that, according to the Gallup Poll,\u00a0just 32 percent of Americans have confidence in the media, and just 14 percent of Republicans.Okay, now on to the Deplorables. We might note that the musical\u00a0Les Mis\u00e9rables,\u00a0a version of the famous novel by Victor Hugo, debuted in Paris in 1980. It opened in London in 1985 and on Broadway in 1987, where it ran for sixteen years. And it\u2019s been running, somewhere, ever since. So yes, there\u2019s lots of cultural resonance.The story itself is a romantic tragedy, set amidst the tumultuous events in early 19th-century France. Indeed, during a seven-decade period, beginning with the French Revolution of 1789, the country seesawed between kings, terrorists, small \u201cr\u201d republicans, and emperors. And along the way, France endured many revolutions and counter-revolutions, some of them extraordinarily violent.So most Americans, who think of themselves as either conservative or moderate, might view the French revolutionary epoch with suspicion. And let\u2019s say up front that our revolution in 1776 (which, interestingly enough, the French aided greatly), is much to be preferred.Yet we can also observe that Americans never went through what the French went through. Our King George III, bad as he might have been, was nothing compared to Louis XVI and the rest of the Bourbon royal family. In the musical, a group of women, slaving in a sweatshop, sing out:At the end of the day it\u2019s another day overWith enough in your pocket to last for a weekPay the landlord, pay the shopKeep on working as long as you\u2019re ableKeep on working till you dropOr it\u2019s back to the crumbs off the tableYou\u2019ve got to pay your wayAt the end of the day!And they continue,There\u2019s a hunger in the landThere\u2019s a reckoning still to be reckoned andThere\u2019s gonna be hell to payAt the end of the day!Yes, that\u2019s the key point: Mistreat people long enough, grind their faces in injustice and inequality long enough, rig the system long enough, and yes, there will be\u00a0hell to pay.Yet those French women weren\u2019t the last ones to be radicalized and to think such radical thoughts. A few years later in Hugo\u2019s tale, in 1832, came an actual historical event, the\u00a0June Rebellion. And here\u00a0Les Mis, both the novel and the musical, insert their fictional characters, expressing the impassioned true thoughts of that era. As one young rebel sings, \u201cThe colors of the world are changing day by day.\u201d And then he belts out a rousing tuneful anthem that might turn even a reactionary into a revolutionary:Red: the blood of angry men!Black: the dark of ages past!Red: a world about to dawn!Black: the night that ends at last!Whether we approve of it or not, the French revolutionary tradition still shapes our modern world. For example, silk stockings and wigs for men survived the American Revolution, and yet after the French Revolution, they were gone. Indeed, the very political terms \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d are products of that era.Yet musical lyrics aside, there are limits to the analogy between French and American politics. Indeed, one needn\u2019t be a chauvinist\u2014to cite another influential concept originated in France\u2014to see that the truest antecedent to Donald Trump, and the Deplorables, is not French but, rather, American.And who would that be? Why, it would be Old Hickory himself, Andrew Jackson (1767-1845). Jackson was a patriot\u2014he joined the forces of the American Revolution at age 13\u2014a war hero, a military governor, a US senator, and, ultimately, our seventh president. Along the way, he killed Indians, British, and more than a few duelists. Was Jackson controversial? You betcha!To be sure, those were rough times. Most of Jackson\u2019s fellow citizens loved him for his crude and violent ways, even as they recognized his patriotic, unionist core; he became a national hero after his smashing 1815 victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans.Jackson ran for president in 1824 and lost, mostly because so few of his supporters could vote; in those days, the voting franchise was severely limited, open only to those who could read and who owned property. Thus Jackson\u2019s \u201crustics\u201d were mostly excluded.In a different country\u2014perhaps in France\u2014a shunned war-hero might then have led a\u00a0coup d\u2019etat. But here in America, Jackson did it the American way; he organized. Aided by his top lieutenant, Martin Van Buren (the future eighth president), Jackson barnstormed many of the 24 states, demanding that the legislatures change the laws to enable more people to vote; most legislatures complied.Here again we see the difference between the US and France. Through our history, for the most part, the American elite has been willing to accede to reasonable demands, if only to stave off revolution. In other words, the system\u00a0can\u00a0work.Jackson ran for president again in 1828; it was the \u201crevolt of the rustics\u201d\u2014a peaceful revolt. The campaign was bitter: It\u2019s fair to say that the Eastern elite of that era were as horrified by Jackson as the Eastern elite of our time are horrified by Trump. Indeed, hard as it might be to believe, the elite were more appalled by the insurgent Jackson back then; in the widely circulated\u00a0coffin handbills, he was accused of everything from adultery to mass murder to cannibalism.Yet despite all this establishment vitriol, Jackson won in a landslide, and the first political era of America, a time of aristocratic leadership, was ended. Indeed, in many ways, our modern political system\u2014that is, two-party politics, with the winner needing the mass-mobilization of the electorate to win\u2014originates from 1828.Thus as we can see, one of the key variables in presidential politics is voter intensity. And on that score, Trump seems to be way ahead. Niall Stanage headlined his piece in\u00a0The Hill,\u00a0\u201cEnthusiasm gap looms for Clinton\u201d:Most strikingly, a CNN/ORC poll indicated that more than 1 in 5 five would-be Clinton voters were \u201cnot at all enthusiastic\u201d about backing her, almost twice as many as said the same about Trump. The poll found 58 percent of Trump supporters saying they felt either \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d enthusiastic about their choice, and only 46 percent in the Clinton camp feeling the same.Indeed, some MSM reporters are starting to wonder, albeit carefully, if Hillary really wants the job. Here\u2019s David A. Graham, writing in\u00a0The Atlantic, asking,\u00a0\u201cJust Why Does Hillary Clinton Want to Be President?\u201dYet Trump, we know, really\u00a0does\u00a0want to be president, and we know why. He has demonstrated the personal drive and also the strong nationalist agenda\u2014Make America Great Again\u2014that Hillary so conspicuously lacks.We might close by recalling the martial wisdom of another important figure from the\u00a0Les Mis\u00a0era, Napoleon Bonaparte. Always analytical about his bloody profession, the French general said that in battle, \u201cThe moral is to the physical as three is to one.\u201d That is, the side with the\u00a0\u00e9lan,\u00a0the energy, is more likely to prevail. Indeed, a fighting spirit can easily overcome a deficit in organization or in dollars.And this year, who has the fighting spirit?

Ultimately, Robertson explains that this is just the latest chapter in a conflict spanning two millennia, described by Augustine of Hippo as the City of Man in opposition to the City of God.Torchbearer\u2014directed by Stephen K. Bannon, produced by Bannon and David Bossie, and written by Bannon, Zach Dasher, and Breitbart News Senior West Coast Editor Rebecca Mansour\u2014gives the viewer a whirlwind tour of world history with a focus on the Christian experience from apostolic times to the present, showcasing the pattern of how godless humanity descends into depravity, in stark contrast to the sublime virtues with which God\u2019s people adorn their lives in the face of adversity\u2014all narrated in the iconic voice of the Duck Commander.Torchbearer\u2019s trailer takes the viewer on a global odyssey from the Areopagus in Athens, to St. Peter\u2019s Square and the Coliseum Rome, to countless rows of white crosses in Normandy, to a jail cell in Birmingham. The full documentary delves deep into each of these venues and more, in a movie that is simultaneously fast-paced yet thought-provoking.\u201cSocial Darwinism. Survival of the fittest.\u201d That is how Robertson summarizes a godless view of human existence, explaining that if there is no higher being to whom man is accountable, the motto becomes, \u201cMight makes right.\u201dRegimes based upon a worldview that rejects God\u2019s authority become violently hostile to those who peacefully live out biblical faith. Ancient Rome was the first example of this after the death and resurrection of Christ, as Christians would not join the new cult of emperor worship. \u201cChristians did not mind praying for the emperor, but they would not pray to the emperor,\u201d Robertson explained.When ordered to offer a small pinch of incense as a sign of worship to the Roman emperor, Christians went willingly to their deaths instead\u2014and were slaughtered en masse.Pivoting to those people, Robertson explains that God is \u201cthe creator of all things. God created man and woman in his image. We are image-bearers of God.\u201dHowever, \u201conce you forget where your rights come from\u2026 oh my goodness,\u201d Robertson sighs. He lays out \u201can indictment of the human race,\u201d quoting from Romans 1:28, \u201cSince they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.\u201dTorchbearer links respect for human rights and a willingness to defend human dignity to faith in God, focusing on the selfless works of service and charity earnestly carried out by countless people of faith.The film also explores the price that countless Christians have paid for their commitment to follow Jesus Christ, beginning with the martyrdom of the apostles Peter and Paul.Stories like these do not merely belong in the past, however, or found solely overseas. Although punishments here have not yet come close to being violent, observant Christians in America are suffering lesser forms of punishment for declining to offer a pinch of incense to the emperor, consequences that are increasing both in frequency and in severity.Just in the past few years:In fact, several of these cases arose just in the past year, and some are still in court today, or are about to go to court. And these are only a fraction of the current struggles going on in America involving observant Christians and people of other faiths.I should know. In addition to being an editor for Breitbart News, I\u2019m a senior attorney at First Liberty Institute, the law firm representing each one of these committed Christians who are suffering what some could call \u201csoft persecution\u201d\u2014nonviolent yet severe personal consequences\u2014because they will not compromise their faith in what they say or how they live their lives.This provocative documentary is designed to inform Americans and give an eternal and spiritual perspective on all these things, setting them in their historical context, and urging people to act\u2014and to repent\u2014before it\u2019s too late.Torchbearer is coming to select theaters on Oct. 7, to be followed by release on various digital and VOD platforms, including Comcast, Dish, iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, and more.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News and senior counsel at First Liberty Institute, the largest law firm in America exclusively dedicated to protecting religious liberty.

Stiller said that if he hadn\u2019t been receiving a regular test called a PSA test to screen for the deadly cancer, he may never have caught it in time.Stiller followed up his appearance on Howard Stern\u2019s show with an essay posted to Medium about his experience.\u201cI got diagnosed with prostate cancer Friday, June 13th, 2014. On September 17th of that year I got a test back telling me I was cancer free,\u201d Stiller wrote. \u201cThe three months in between were a crazy roller coaster ride with which about 180,000 men a year in America can identify.\u201dHe continued:\u201cTaking the PSA test saved my life. Literally. That\u2019s why I am writing this now. There has been a lot of controversy over the test in the last few years. Articles and op-eds on whether it is safe, studies that seem to be interpreted in many different ways, and debates about whether men should take it all. I am not offering a scientific point of view here, just a personal one, based on my experience. The bottom line for me: I was lucky enough to have a doctor who gave me what they call a \u201cbaseline\u201d PSA test when I was about 46. I have no history of prostate cancer in my family and I am not in the high-risk group, being neither\u200a\u2014\u200ato the best of my knowledge\u200a\u2014\u200aof African or Scandinavian ancestry. I had no symptoms.\u201dThe actor praised the \u201cthoughtful\u201d internist who conducted PSA tests on him, avoiding guidelines set forth by by the American Cancer Society to wait until age 50 to conduct them. The actor wrote that critics of the test contend that,\u00a0\u201cdepending on how they interpret the data, doctors can send patients for further tests like the MRI and the more invasive biopsy, when not needed.\u201d\u201cBut without this PSA test itself, or any screening procedure at all, how are doctors going to detect asymptomatic cases like mine, before the cancer has spread and metastasized throughout one\u2019s body rendering it incurable?\u201d Stiller wrote.Stiller\u00a0concluded by revealing that he has now been cancer-free for two years. The actor and filmmaker has a number of projects coming up, both in front of and behind the camera, including a starring role opposite Adam Sandler and Dustin Hoffman in Noah Baumbach\u2019s next movie and as a producer on Dodgeball 2 and Jack Black comedy The Polka King.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, Ben Stiller, Howard Stern, prostate cancer, PSA TestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The bit where she said:\u201cWe are pouring all of our money, all of our effort, all of our prayers into a bucket and the bucket has a hole in the bottom. That hole is climate change.\u201dThis is probably the truest, wisest, cleverest thing any climate alarmist scientist has ever said in history \u2013 even the truth only came out by accident and not in the way she intended.But yes, the whole climate change industry is indeed like pouring trillions of dollars (and hope and effort and prayers, etc) into a bucket with an almighty hole in it.Here, by way of a reminder, is the rough annual cost of the climate change industry \u2013 $1.5 trillion.And here is what the combined decarbonisation efforts of the world\u2019s industrial and developing nations are going to achieve by the end of the century thanks to the vital COP21 summit in Paris last year.A reduction in global temperatures by the end of the century of 0.048 degrees C \u2013 ie around 1/20th of a degree C.If this represents a sensible use of scarce resources, I would love to hear acclaimed climate expert and economist Leonardo DiCaprio explain how. Then perhaps he could go on to explain the still unexplained mystery of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation\u2019s connections with a $3 billion \u00a0Malaysian embezzlement scheme.2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood, Breitbart London, Before the Flood, Climate Change, Donald Trump, Leonardo DiCaprio, national geographic, ObamaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

If we\u2019ve done our jobs properly, they also have more laughs and suspense \u2013 and\u00a0much\u00a0better artwork,\u201d Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cClinton Cash: A Graphic Novel\u00a0is the most subversive foray into pop culture the right has ever attempted and, more importantly, it has been successful.\u00a0So successful and effective in fact that it was recently banned from the shelves of a Florida Public Library.\u201dIndeed, as Breitbart News reported, the\u00a0Alachua County Library District denied\u00a0county\u00a0resident Ann Loot\u2019s\u00a0request to place\u00a0Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel\u00a0on its shelves \u2014 a ban that occurred mere weeks before the start of Banned Books Week.The graphic novel was always meant to convey the fact-based reporting found in\u00a0Clinton Cash\u00a0\u201cin a way that makes it accessible to people who don\u2019t have time to sit down and read a serious nonfiction book,\u201d\u00a0Clinton Cash\u00a0author and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter\u00a0Schweizer\u00a0told\u00a0Fox & Friends\u00a0in a recent interview.\u201cI think millennials love this sort of approach because it\u2019s humorous,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cThey put in humor. It\u2019s a lot of great visual images.\u201dIn an appearance in August on\u00a0Breitbart News Daily\u00a0SiriusXM radio, Smith, reiterating what Schweizer had said, said the book\u2019s form as a\u00a0\u201csubversive\u201d message to young Americans is what initially attracted him to the project.\u201cOne of the things that really attracted me to the project was it gave us an opportunity to do something really subversive \u2013 probably one of the most subversive things the Right has done when it comes to pop culture maybe since\u00a0Clinton Cash, the documentary,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd of course, Andrew [Breitbart] always said that politics is downstream from culture. And I was really interested in seeing if we could make those two intersect. And I think we were able to do that in a crisp, engaging and new way with\u00a0Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel, and we do that through humor, which is also something which I think is new and cutting edge \u2013 definitely avant-garde for the Right \u2013 using satire and humor, parody, mockery.\u201d\u201cThe Right has not lost the culture war. The Right has almost ceded the culture war by not engaging, and I really wanted to use the Left\u2019s weapons back on them,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cIt\u2019s payback time. They don\u2019t own pop culture. They don\u2019t own it all. They don\u2019t own that territory, and we need to start taking it back. Jon Stewart just signed a four-year deal with HBO. He\u2019s got an animation studio geared up. He\u2019s got 3-D graphics cranking.

Neither Kardashian nor Moms Demand noted that the alleged gunman behind the church attack acquired his gun via a background check.On June 12, 2016 \u2014 the very day of the deadly firearm-based attack at a nightclub in Orlando \u2014 Kardashian called for expanding background checks in a way that would prevent persons on the terror watch list from acquiring guns. She tweeted, \u201cUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap.\u201dUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap\u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 12, 2016Kardashian did not mention that the Orlando attacker was not on a terror watch list, so adding such a list to background checks would have done nothing to prevent his attack.On August 5, 2016, Kardashian\u2019s gun control advocacy grew, as did her ties to Moms Demand Action. She and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe\u00a0met with family members of gun violence victims at an event organized\u00a0by Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety.\u00a0The Hollywood Gossip\u00a0reported on the event and quoted\u00a0Kim saying, \u201cHaving lunch with the families of loved ones who were killed by gun violence. I learned a lot from listening to their stories.\u201d She added, \u201cLife is so precious! What will it take for this to stop?\u201d She gave a shout-out to \u201cEverytown [for Gun Safety]\u201d and \u201cMoms Demand.\u201dThen came October 2, 2016, in Paris \u2014 in a city with nearly every gun control measure on the Democrats\u2019 wish list \u2014 and the reality TV star\u00a0was held at gunpoint by armed men who reportedly locked her in a bathroom and stole cellphones and jewelry worth around $10 million.

But the singer\u2019s remarks constantly veered into\u00a0presidential politics.Warning millennial voters, Cher said, \u201cThey need to know is that this election will change America and have consequences for the world for 40 years and the people who will suffer the most are millennials.\u201d\u201cAnd they will suffer because the people he will bring with him will put an end to any hope that women have of getting the rights we had in Roe v Wade. I believe they will put an end to any gay marriage. They will put an end to gay adoption. They will put an end to so many services that we do for the old, the young, the starving,\u201d she added.Cher continued: \u201cI would say that it has such far-reaching consequences and\u2014look, it\u2019s not going to hurt me, I\u2019m 70, it\u2019s not going to do anything to me\u2014it\u2019s going to do stuff to young people and that really scares me and it bothers me.\u201dNot known to shy\u00a0away from sharing her thoughts on Trump\u2019s political rise, Cher called the real estate magnate a\u00a0\u201cf*cking idiot\u201d and compare Trump to Hitler\u00a0during a\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0for Clinton in August.During the animal rights-centered event in Canada, Cher also turned her ire\u00a0toward Trump\u2019s son\u2019s, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump, who caused controversy after\u00a0posting a photo showing them celebrating the killing of a leopard they hunted during a trip to Africa.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s sons, there\u2019s a picture of them holding a dead leopard. And I think that when that kind of message is sent from people who are influential, it\u2019s the exact wrong message,\u201d Cher said. \u201cIt changes the mindset of people, they become numb to what\u2019s going on.\u201dFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\u00a0@JeromeEHudson2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood, Hillary Clinton, 2016 presidential race, Big Hollywood, Cher, Hillary Clinton, Millennials, One Young World SummitComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

While the race remains nail-bitingly close in several battleground states, Friday\u2019s Los Angeles Times tracking poll has Trump up six points on Clinton nationally, well outside the poll\u2019s margin of error.With time running out, reinforcements arrived just this week\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in the form of Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Megan Mullally, Sean Hayes and Alec Baldwin.The effort began Monday\u00a0when NBC dropped a \u201cnew scene\u201d from its beloved late 90s-early 2000s sitcom Will and Grace. The show\u2019s core four cast members had teased a reunion on social media all week, with a final video teaser promising \u201cWill & Grace is back\u201d sending fans of the show into a frenzy.The ten-minute scene, released online, is heavy on zingers directed toward Trump as Karen (Mullally), a Trump supporter, tries to convince the undecided Jack (Hayes) to vote for the Republican candidate.\u201cHoney, if you don\u2019t vote for Trumpy, there will be wars and monsoons and locusts and hordes of brown people pouring over our borders from every direction,\u201d Karen tells him. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re sitting in the audience at Hamilton, but do you really want to see those people everywhere?\u201dThere\u2019s jokes about how Karen helped \u201cpick out\u201d Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, and about how the \u201cazure green\u201d of the sea at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida pairs\u00a0nicely with the \u201cmahogany brown\u201d of the resort\u2019s staff.It goes on like that for a while.\u00a0Jack is ultimately convinced to vote for Clinton when he\u2019s told that that\u2019s who Katy Perry is voting for.Fast forward to\u00a0Wednesday, when Saturday Night Live announced that frequent guest-host Alec Baldwin, fresh off of a stint hosting ABC\u2019s reboot of Match Game, would play the role of Trump throughout the entirety of the show\u2019s upcoming 42nd season.Baldwin \u2014 who has guested on the program a record 16 times \u2014 is no stranger to the show\u2019s political sketches. He appeared\u00a0in a 2008 skit\u00a0alongside Tina Fey, who played former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in perhaps the show\u2019s most influential (and damaging) depiction of a politician ever.In fact, it was Fey herself who suggested Baldwin for the Trump role to SNL producer Lorne Michaels earlier this summer, Michaels told the Hollywood Reporter in an interview this week.\u201cWe were talking about who should do it,\u201d Michaels told THR. \u201cAnd [Fey] said, \u2018Well, the person that should really play it is Alec.\u2019 And I went, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 A light went on.\u201dNBC released a teaser trailer for its October 1 season premiere along with the announcement of Baldwin\u2019s casting on Wednesday. The promo hypes a matchup between Baldwin\u2019s Trump and Kate McKinnon\u2019s Clinton in what will\u00a0almost\u00a0surely be a send-up of Monday night\u2019s presidential debate.Neither of these developments would matter much if they didn\u2019t illustrate so clearly the level of desperation at which\u00a0both\u00a0the political and cultural Left finds itself\u00a0as the race enters its final stretch.Celebrities getting involved in politics during an election year is practically pass\u00e9, at this point. The cast of the West Wing is campaigning for Clinton in Ohio. The stars of The Avengers cut an anti-Trump PSA\u00a0for Joss Whedon\u2019s pro-Clinton Super PAC. The current and former cast and crew of the Star Trek franchise angrily denounced Trump in an open letter. Katy Perry and Zach Galifianakis worked\u00a0the Funny or Die comedy clip circuit in support of Clinton, while Madonna shed her clothes\u00a0and posted a photo to social media\u00a0in an effort to get out the vote.But Will and Grace and SNL are the big guns.The former\u00a0picked up 16 Emmy Awards over its eight-year run and is often cited by media experts as being hugely influential in Americans\u2019 perception of gay people. University of Minnesota professor Greg Schappa told NPR in a 2012 interview that the show was a \u201cturning point\u201d in American discourse on gay rights, and no less than Vice President Joe Biden has credited the show with having done \u201cmore to educate the American public\u201d about gay people than any other entertainment or education initiative.The reunion clip has already been viewed more than five million times.Meanwhile, conservatives needn\u2019t be reminded of how influential Saturday Night Live can be with its send-ups of politicians. Sarah Palin never said, \u201cI can see Russia from my house;\u201d that was Tina Fey mocking the vice presidential nominee in just one of the skits that became devastatingly effective at painting her as geographically challenged and stupid.SNL began going after Trump last season, most notably with a \u201cRacists for Trump\u201d fake campaign advertisement that featured neo-Nazis and white supremacists encouraging people to vote for the Republican candidate.But the\u00a0possibility of Trump winning the presidency\u00a0has become so dire for the left, that some, including former SNL staffer and liberal media personality Dean Obeidallah, say that the show has a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to highlight Trump\u2019s \u201cracism, sexism and bigotry\u201d in its upcoming season.\u201cEighty million people watched the debate, 130 million people will vote, 50 million others are still looking for places to get their news, and comedy can fill that gap,\u201d Obeidallah told Politico this week. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s going to take comedians to do the job that cable news has relinquished for so much of the campaign.\u201dEarlier this month, reports surfaced that Hollywood Democrats were quietly panicking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s weaknesses and Trump\u2019s electoral prospects in the election\u2019s closing stretch. Worried liberals reportedly cornered\u00a0Republican pollster Frank Luntz at an Emmy Awards after-party and peppered him with questions about Trump\u2019s chances, only to be informed that the\u00a0pollster\u00a0could no longer guarantee a Clinton victory, much to their horror.What is clear with the latest salvos from two cultural mainstays\u00a0is that the panic is no longer quiet. In 39 days, Hollywood\u00a0and the rest of the left will find out if their last-ditch effort can bring down the one candidate they can\u2019t afford to see elected.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dnzussbaum2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood, Alec Baldwin, Debra Messing, Donald Trump, Eric McCormack, Hillary Clinton, Megan Mullally, NBC, Saturday Night Live, Sean Hayes, SNL, Will and GraceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

We shouldn\u2019t live in a society so awash with guns that [it] makes the cops fearful and makes them suspicious of everybody.\u201dThe Breakfast Club host DJ Envy said, \u201cYou travel a lot. You\u2019ve been to Toronto, you\u2019ve been to Japan, and you notice when you go to a lot of these countries, people are not allowed to have guns.\u201d Legend interjected, \u201cYes, and their murder rates are way lower. Their suicide rates are lower, too, because when people have guns, they end up using them.\u201dEnvy asked, \u201cSo banning guns in full, you\u2019re saying?\u201dLegend responded:I\u2019m not saying that necessarily would work. But if we look at Australia, they did something over there. They had a few mass shootings, and they said, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re going to take a pretty significant approach to reducing the amount of guns on the streets.\u201d And it worked. They didn\u2019t have another mass shooting, their murder rate went down, and we won\u2019t do it here because we got the Second Amendment. We got the NRA that\u2019s going to lobby against it. And maybe it won\u2019t be constitutional to do that, but at the end of the day, it actually worked. And if we want\u00a0to talk about what makes us safer, that would make us safer.First, Australia\u2019s gun confiscation scheme was fashioned as a gun buyback\u2013a mandatory buyback\u2013where people\u00a0with guns the government wished to ban were required to turn in\u00a0those\u00a0guns. The scheme resulted in the confiscation of somewhere between 650,000 and 1,000,000 firearms during the years 1996-1997. (Figures vary.) On September 13, 2016, Breitbart News reported that Australia is considering a new body of gun laws to fight the rising gun crime that is marring Melbourne, Australia, and much of Victoria. In fact, Melbourne has had more than one shooting a week since January 2015.But the Australian model is Legend\u2019s solution?Second, part of what Australia is now considering to fight gun crime is an \u201camnesty\u201d whereby criminals will have a period of time to turn their guns in without penalty. Ironically, during Legend\u2019s appearance on The Breakfast Club, he was told a lot of people do not turn in their guns during buybacks because they are afraid that the gun\u2013and the crimes committed with it\u2013will somehow be traced back to them. Legend responded by suggesting some type of \u201camnesty\u201d period to get guns off the street.So he is pushing the Australian gun buyback that did not prevent criminals from having guns in the first place and is also pushing the second phase of that failed policy: \u201camnesty\u201d for criminals with guns.Legend also blamed Chicago\u2019s gun crime on Indiana, claiming that criminals in Chicago go to Indiana to buy their guns. This opened the door for him to criticize the differences in gun laws from state to state in the U.S. He said, \u201cWe\u2019d have to do something nationally that was much more pervasive to get rid of guns.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Look. It\u2019s the Amazons. They\u2019re gay!'\u201d Rucka said of his\u00a0new\u00a0Wonder Woman\u00a0series for DC Comics, which launched in June 2016 as part of the\u00a0DC Rebirth\u00a0relaunch.\u201cAnd when you start to think about giving the concept of Themyscira its due, the answer is, \u2018How can they not all be in same sex relationships?\u2019 Right? It makes no logical sense otherwise.\u201dRucka continued to explain how given that her homeland is inhabited by only women, it\u2019s obvious that if Wonder Woman was romantically involved, that it would be with a woman.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be paradise. You\u2019re supposed to be able to live happily. You\u2019re supposed to be able \u2014 in a context where one can live happily, and part of what an individual needs for that happiness is to have a partner \u2014 to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women,\u201d he said. \u201cBut an Amazon doesn\u2019t look at another Amazon and say, \u2018You\u2019re gay.\u2019 They don\u2019t. The concept doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201cNow, are we saying Diana has been in love and had relationships with other women? As Nicola and I approach it, the answer is obviously yes,\u201d Rucka said.Over the course of her 75-year comic book run, Wonder Woman\u2019s romantic story arc has been largely represented by her relationship with\u00a0soldier Steve Trevor, who first met the Amazon Princess after he washed up on Paradise Island.That romantic story arc is also the basis for DC Entertainment\u2019s $150 million big screen adaptation of Wonder Woman, set to hit theaters in 2017. The film stars Gal Gaddot as the sword and shield-wielding\u00a0heroine and Chris Pine as\u00a0Steve Trevor.\u201cWhen we talk about agency of characters in 2016, Diana deciding to leave her home forever \u2014 which is what she believes she\u2019s doing \u2014 if she does that because she\u2019s fallen for a guy, I believe that diminishes her heroism,\u201d he contends. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t leave because of Steve. She leaves because she wants to see the world and somebody must go and do this thing. And she has resolved it must be her to make this sacrifice.\u201dRucka also made it clear that DC Comics is wholly supportive of his take on Wonder Woman\u2019s character.\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t like the idea that there are people out there who might think DC is being mealy-mouthed about this. They\u2019re not. No one wants to be taken out of context by ignorant people, but nobody at DC has ever said, \u2018She\u2019s gotta be straight.\u2019 Nobody. Ever. They\u2019ve never blinked at this,\u201d he said.Read Rucka\u2019s full interview with Comicosity here.\u00a0Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\u00a0@JeromeEHudsonBig Hollywood, Chris Rucka, DC Comics, Gal Gadot, lgbt, queer, Steve Trevor, Wonder WomanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Is that reflective of how you would treat a human?

It\u2019s not something we\u2019re wanting to highlight or trying to highlight, but I think the criticism is point taken on it.\u201dSeries star\u00a0Thandie Newton also defended the show from accusations that it is too sexually violent, arguing that \u201cit will create moments for conversation which are so valuable for people.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t have any reservations because I knew how it was going to be depicted,\u201d the actress\u00a0told the Press Association. \u201cI knew how it was going to be central to the narrative \u2013 I mean central.

It feels so delicious,\u201d he mocked. \u201cI get so much attention from people. It is what defines me, what makes me alive. I\u2019m showing off my wounds so you can lick them. Don\u2019t they taste so good? Don\u2019t they make me so important? If you define yourself through a trauma that happened to you, and that is still a part of you, you are probably sick and in need of help.\u201d\u201cIf you cannot read Shakespeare, or Melville, or Toni Morrison because it will trigger something traumatic in you, and you\u2019ll be harmed by the reading of the text because you are still defining yourself through your self-victimization, then you need to see a doctor,\u201d Ellis continued. \u201cIf you feel you are experiencing microaggressions because someone asks you where you are from, or \u2018can you help me with my math,\u2019 or offers a \u2018god bless you\u2019 after you sneeze, and you feel like all of this is some kind of mass societal dis, then you need to seek help. Professional help.\u201dEllis continued to brand the \u201cwidespread epidemic of self-victimization\u201d and \u201cdefining yourself\u201d by \u201ca traumatic thing that happened to you in the past\u201d as an illness.\u201cIt is something you need to resolve before you re-enter society,\u201d he stated. \u201cWhat you are doing to yourself is harming yourself, and seriously annoying others around you. The fact that you can\u2019t listen to a joke, view imagery, and that you categorize everything as either sexist, or racist, or homophobic, whether it is or not, and therefore harmful to you and you just can\u2019t take it, is a kind of mania, a delusion, a psychosis that we have been coddling, encouraging people to think that life should be a smooth utopia built only for them and their fragile sensibility. In essence, staying a child forever. Living in a fairy-tale.\u201dCriticizing the dozens of professional victims who appear to make a living out of being oppressed, Ellis added that \u201cyes, it\u2019s difficult for someone at seventeen to move past a childhood trauma and pain, but not really at 27, or 34, or 49, or 56,\u201d before claiming that not only can pain be useful, but that it is also often the \u201cbuilding block for great novels, and music, and art.\u201d\u201cWhen I first started hearing professional victims demanding that things shouldn\u2019t be posted or shown, or posts should be blocked, or people should be punished and shamed and blamed or fired because they offended the victim on some level, I\u2019d laugh at how ridiculous it all was. But then get queasy when a certain faction would try and appease the victims, elevating them to hero status,\u201d confessed Ellis. \u201cBut now a backlash is beginning against PC victim culture perpetrating itself onto the rest of us, instead of letting victims wallow in their own self-victimization, proudly asserting it, demanding everyone pays respect to their pain. A pain that, honestly, no one really cares about, except other victims. Because a victim is not active. A victim is passive. A victim is someone who can\u2019t move on, and so it\u2019s doubly frustrating to listen to their complaints.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about acceptance and moving the fuck on,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe University of Chicago sent a letter to its incoming freshman classes this summer, the class of 2020, stating in essence that there will be no trigger warnings or safe spaces allowed. That there will be no crackdown on microaggressions, and that visiting speakers will be allowed to speak without being boycotted because a fraction of the student body doesn\u2019t agree with what the speaker represents, or the ideas that the speaker may want to talk about.\u201d\u201cThis announcement was greeted by almost everyone with a huge sigh of relief,\u201d stated Ellis. \u201cMoving forward, a progression in not coddling students and keeping them victims and babies, and instead making them adults dealing with the world that is mostly hostile to your dreams, your ideals, and restoring the university as a place where young adults can stop shutting things down [and start] building themselves up by empowering them with ideas that are different from their own.\u201dCiting recent controversies surrounding Nate Parker and Lena Dunham, Ellis claimed them to be \u201creminders of the infantilization victim culture that was and is still to a degree everywhere.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s all amusing. Maybe it\u2019s not a problem at all, maybe it\u2019s all just entertainment. Everyone\u2019s a racist, maybe every man is ultimately a rapist, whatever,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut there\u2019s a child-like attitude toward the world in this kind of over-emotional lashing out, and the culture of blame.\u201d\u201cIt almost seems at times as if kids are running the world,\u201d concluded Ellis. \u201cFeelings are not fact.\u201dYou can listen to Ellis\u2019 full podcast episode here.Big Hollywood, Social Justice, Tech, Bret Easton Ellis, SJWs, victim cultureComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Baldwin previously starred in Michaels\u2019 NBC comedy 30 Rock, and\u00a0the 58-year-old actor has guest-hosted\u00a0SNL a record 16 times. He previously played former Republican presidential aspirant Rick Perry in 2011.The show has had some success going with outside hires to play presidential candidates in election years; in 2008, SNL alum Tina Fey returned to the show to play former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, while Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David played Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders in sketches last season.David was also on set when Trump himself hosted an episode of SNL last year. The actor interrupted Trump during his opening monologue with shouts of \u201cYou\u2019re a racist!\u201d before revealing that he made the interruption to cash in on an activist group\u2019s promise to pay him for it.Baldwin has been largely silent about Trump during this year\u2019s election, though he told Howard Stern last year that a \u201cpart\u201d of him would \u201clove to see Trump win.\u201d The Baldwin-hosted remake of classic game show Match Game has featured celebrities making fun of the Republican candidate.Despite kicking off on October 1, the upcoming season of SNL has already faced some early controversy with the hiring of new cast member Melissa Villase\u00f1or. The first Latina\u00a0cast member in the show\u2019s 40-year history was criticized on Twitter for allegedly deleting more than 2,000 old messages on her Twitter account that critics deemed racist and offensive.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood, Alec Baldwin, Donald Trump, Lorne Michaels, Saturday Night Live, SNLComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

On the journey, the actor meets dignitaries and business leaders\u00a0including President Obama, Pope Francis, John Kerry and Elon Musk in an attempt to learn more about what can be done to save the planet from the effects of climate change.The film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month, is set to be screened on the White House\u2019s South Lawn on October 3 as part of the inaugural South by South Lawn (SXSL) arts festival.Before the screening, DiCaprio will meet with President Obama and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe for a conversation focusing on ways to end climate change.Before the Flood is directed by Fisher Stevens, who won an Oscar for his 2009 documentary The Cove.In an interview with Variety at the Toronto Film Festival, Stevens said the project had gotten off the ground when DiCaprio called him and expressed interest in making a climate change documentary, and added that the actor was the perfect ambassador to carry the film\u2019s message.\u201cHe was made the Messenger of Peace for climate change by the U.N., so we kind of used that as our jump-off for the movie,\u201d Stevens said of DiCaprio\u2019s involvement. \u201cLeo\u2019s an amazing voice.

In May, the singer wore a butt-exposing outfit to the Met Ball Gala in order to make a self-described \u201cpolitical statement\u201d about women\u2019s rights.\u201cThe fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an age-ist and sexist society,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram account that month.Of course, Madonna\u2019s support for Clinton may be influenced by family bias; the Washington Post reported in 2007 that Clinton and Madonna are 10th cousins who share the same great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather.

She did nothing during the debate to change the trajectory of those increasingly bleak polls.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s primary charge against Mr. Trump is that he lacks the \u201ctemperament\u201d to be president. In an easy glide Monday night, Mr. Trump\u00a0demonstrated otherwise.He was perfectly presidential, even if a bit unpolished at times \u2014 just the way so many of his supporters love him. He was poised and even a bit mannerly at times.Perhaps a bit too mannerly. But we\u2019ll get to that.Mrs. Clinton failed to do anything that will change the overwhelming view of her that she is slick, calculating and out of touch. And her plastic smile and that practiced, canned laugh \u2014 including a truly bizarre shoulder jiggle at one point \u2014 will only feed the notion that she is not really all there.In addition, Mrs. Clinton failed to land any devastating punches on Mr. Trump. She landed a few potent shots about his tax proposals and his tax returns, but nothing extraordinary. And nothing anywhere near as withering as everything everybody in both parties and the media have already hurled at the guy.\u00a0From the start, the debate was lively and fiery. That was not because of the moderator, and it certainly was not because Hillary Clinton was on stage. It was entirely owing to Mr. Trump\u2019s presence.Something about his swashbuckling manner always puts people off kilter a little, and the result always seems to be a debate that is more robust and honest \u2014 if sometimes a bit imprecise.As for moderator Lester Holt, he will be excoriated in coming days for his multiple follow-up questions of Mr. Trump and his failure to ask even the most basic questions of Mrs. Clinton.She also used up a number of lines that she had obviously practice extensively \u2014 to little effect.\u201cI know you live in your own reality,\u201d she said at one point, but it was entirely lost in muddle.But here is where Mr. Trump has a lot of room to improve.Instead of simply prosecuting the case against Mrs. Clinton, he dutifully answered all of Mr. Holt\u2019s questions and responded to all of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s jabs \u2014 no matter how silly.After successfully turning questions about his unreleased tax returns into questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 destroyed emails, Mr. Trump\u00a0dutifully changed the subject back to his tax returns and spent far more time explaining that. Forget the tax returns and hammer away at the emails.One of his sharpest moments came when he repeatedly hammered her for an answer on whether the economy and bad trade deals was the fault of President Obama or former President Bill Clinton.In truth, that is the entire crux of his campaign and if he sticks with it, he will win.He is most effective when he is reminding people that Hillary Clinton has been around on the national political stage for the better part of three decades and only now offering to fix things.\u201cWhy are you just thinking of these solutions now?\u201d he asked in possibly his best line.A good runner-up was when he acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton has plenty of experience, \u201cbut it\u2019s bad, bad experience.\u201dThe really good news for Donald Trump supporters is that if we have learned nothing else from this election, it is that Mr. Trump is a fast learner. He was very good in this debate. He will be even better in the next.\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Hollywood, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Lester Holt, Presidential DebateComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

As you know, I tried very, very hard \u2014 as did you \u2014 to prevent it from being a binary choice from Hillary and Donald Trump. And I think it is fair to say there was no other Republican candidate who left more on the field and did more to stop Donald from being the nominee than I did. But the voters made a different decision. And you have to respect the democratic process, even if you may not be terribly happy with the outcome.\u201dListen to the Cruz interview:\u201cI just want to make sure I understand,\u201d Beck asked him. \u201cSo a man who has principles, who says, \u2018I will \u2014 there are lines I will not cross.\u2019 It\u2019s still a binary choice. So a man who you cannot come on and say, \u2018Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,\u2019 I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it\u2019s a binary choice?\u201d\u201cYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable and principled. And from my perspective, as I look at the issues, Hillary Clinton is telling us she will do enormous damage to the country,\u201d Cruz replied.The Senator\u00a0then explained again in detail the differences he sees between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary\u00a0Clinton.\u201cYou had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,\u201d Beck shot back.\u201cHave you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump?\u201d Beck demanded to know. \u201cDo you have new information that has made you say, \u2018Oh, my gosh, he\u2019s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy that I \u2014 I \u2014 I very eloquently spelled out for over a year and now suddenly there\u2019s a reason to believe him?\u2019\u201dCruz responded by again stating his belief that the general election involves \u201ca binary choice\u201d between Clinton and Trump, and every constitutional conservative agrees that Clinton would be a disastrous choice, especially in regards to appointing Supreme Court justices \u2013 an issue of special importance to Cruz, who was a former solicitor general.In explaining the timing of his Trump endorsement, Cruz noted that it\u00a0came on the heels of Trump releasing an expanded list of conservative justices and promising\u00a0that \u201cthe only nominees he would consider for the court were on that list.\u201d He also noted Trump\u2019s recent support\u00a0for Cruz\u2019s efforts to prevent President Obama from handing over Internet domain control from American supervision to an international body.Beck ended the interview by demanding to know if Cruz had sold his campaign\u2019s email list to Trump, as was recently reported by Politico.The question came up as Beck was about to break for a commercial, but he refused to cut away until he had an answer:BECK: I just have \u2014 I have one more question, and this is worth $20,000 to me. Bump the next commercial, please. Take that first commercial. Give me the extra minute for his response because I\u2019m up against a network break.All of us have received pro-Trump emails, and we\u2019re now on the Trump bandwagon. I have taken advertising from Donald Trump. And I would take advertising from Hillary Clinton because this is a business and I don\u2019t believe keeping options gone.However, I think everybody should be able to have their voice heard on the public airwaves. However, me getting information or email list now on Donald Trump is really rather annoying. The only person that I ever gave my information to was you.As a candidate, you do not have to sell your list. Did you sell your list to Donald Trump?CRUZ: Well, Glenn, as you noted on your radio show, you sell advertising. It\u2019s actually what funds your radio show. And that\u2019s true of, as far as any radio show, that\u2019s how one communicates. That\u2019s also true of every candidate. You don\u2019t sell your list, but you rent your list. So if someone wants to access your supporters, they pay for it. And that helps fund your efforts. And so like every other candidate, sure, we have rented our list out for those who wish to pay for it. That is true, by the way, of every other candidate.And so, yeah, there\u2019s a hit piece today in Politico, a left-wing rag that wants to \u2014 that is hitting me\u2014BECK: Oh, my gosh.CRUZ: \u2014but somehow is not applying that standard to anyone else in the political world or for that matter anyone else on radio who sells advertising every day to fund communicating with the voters.BECK: Well, I do have that same standard. Thank you very much. Ted, I disagree with you. I disagree with you strongly, but I still respect you as a man. And you have done a lot of great. And I hope you continue to do a lot of great work in the future. Thank you for coming on the program.CRUZ: Well, Glenn, and you are my friend. I continue to respect you \u2014CRUZ: I have to break. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, I have to break for this network. Here we go.After returning from break, Beck and his co-hosts expressed their disappointment in Cruz\u2019s answers.Listen to the post-interview discussion:Beck in particular was disillusioned with the man he once described as \u201cthe next George Washington,\u201d \u201canointed\u201d by God\u00a0and \u201craised for these times.\u201d\u201cFor the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAnd when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me. And it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s my fault for believing that men can actually be George Washington. It\u2019s my fault.\u201dHe continued:I should have said, \u201cYou know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio. And I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there\u2019s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on. And he\u2019s kind of a politician, but he\u2019s a different kind of politician: He\u2019s a young politician. He\u2019s a Hispanic. He can win. Let\u2019s go for it!\u201d Instead, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s find a truly honorable man.\u201d And that will always let you down. It will always let you down.Beck said that it would have been better if\u00a0Cruz\u00a0had\u00a0said\u00a0that he only endorsed Trump to appease his donors and supporters.\u00a0\u201cSo he could have come on and said, \u2018Look, guys, here\u2019s the thing: My supporters are yelling at me.\u2019 And I know that, because so are mine,\u201d Beck said.Beck continued imagining what Cruz could have said:\u201cMy donors, who were all in with the G.O.P., they\u2019re all saying, \u2018I\u2019ll never fund you \u2014 I won\u2019t fund you for the Senate. I won\u2019t fund you for the run in 2020.\u2019 And I have to make a decision. So the question is: Do I completely shut myself out of this game, or do I play the game as much as I possibly can? Look, there\u2019s nobody that has held out longer than me,\u201d he should have said.\u201cIf he would have just come on and said that, I would have had a lot easier time. But to become the politician is disappointing. Really disappointing,\u201d Beck concluded, though he later added that Cruz \u201cis still a good man.\u201dBeck ended the segment by returning to an argument he\u2019s expressed before: that the United States is not a geographic location defined by sovereign borders and inhabited by specific people. It is rather \u201can idea.\u201dBeck explained:Look, I want you to listen very carefully to me because this is going to sound pretty outrageous: I am not here to fight for the \u2014 for the saving of America. I am not here to fight for the saving of this land. I am not here to save the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the system that we have built. I am here and you are here \u2014 we all are here for this time to save the idea of America.America is no more than that: an idea, that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. And among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That you have charge over your own life and you only answer to God, and God gives you those rights, and you give some of those rights to the government for protection. And the minute that that government begins to infringe on any of those rights, it is not just your \u2014 not just your willingness, it is your duty to overthrow anyone who would take those rights away.Those rights are what have us say, \u201cI can do this. I can build a better mousetrap. I could be president. I could build a rocket and go to Mars. I can be left alone. I can participate. I can not participate.\u201d It\u2019s an idea that had never, ever happened before.And right now, what we are arguing about is the \u2014 is the destruction of our banking system. The destruction of our two-party system. The destruction of our capital. The destruction of law and order, whatever the hell that even means anymore. The destruction of our culture. The destruction of our churches, whatever the hell that means anymore.I don\u2019t care if my children are more rich or less rich than me. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care.What I do care is that my children are free to be able to chart their own course, free to be able to work or not work and starve. My children have a right to worship in the way they see fit and to move as their conscience tells them to move. Right now, we have become PETA. Shame on all of us. Why not \u2014 just if you won\u2019t vote for Hillary our you won\u2019t vote for Trump, why not just cover me in a bucket of blood? Why not just shame me in the public square? Why not run them out of business? They\u2019re climate deniers!There is no difference between the two teams anymore. Oh, sure, one\u2019s for a little lower taxes. One is the for border, one is not. One is for international rule, one is for national rule.Which one is for the idea that all men are created equal, that all men have a right to pursue their own happiness and make their own goddamn decision? Which one? Which one?I contend neither of them. And so we will just soak each other in buckets of blood. We\u2019ll be a happy little bumper sticker community that shames one another into making sure you walk in goose-step with all the other Hillary supporters or walk in goose-step with all the other Trump supporters. Because she\u2019s going to mean the destruction of America. No, no, says the Hillary supporter, you must vote for us because he means the destruction of America.I contend they both mean the destruction of the idea.Listen to Beck\u2019s full interview with Cruz and the post-interview discussion above.Follow Rebecca Mansour on Twitter\u00a0@RAMansour2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Hollywood, Glenn Beck, Marco Rubio, Ted CruzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Williams, Ph.D.26 Sep 20160In this visually riveting documentary\u00a0titled \u201cTorchbearer\u201d by veteran filmmaker Stephen K. Bannon, Robertson proposes that civilizations that abandon God as the bedrock of their rights and liberties wind up falling into nihilism and decay.The Duck Dynasty patriarch is an unapologetic witness to the Christian faith as the cornerstone of Western Civilization, which has earned him the undying ire of the right-thinking Left. The film begins with a series of vignettes showing some of Robertson\u2019s more controversial comments and the righteous rage they have provoked among the politically correct.Pilloried in the mainstream media for his traditional, biblically based views on topics such as human sexuality and religious liberty, Robertson has been labeled racist, homophobic, ignorant and bigoted\u2014all for espousing positions that up to a generation ago were considered normal and mainstream in U.S. society.Early in the film, one unidentified commentator says of Robertson that he \u201clooks like a homeless lunatic who might shoot you.\u201dAnd yet, as this bearded modern Jeremiah expounds his case for Christianity and a return to God, he comes across as remarkably articulate and theologically nuanced, appealing variously to philosophy, history and common sense.Striking the pose of a biblical patriarch, Robertson cuts an impressive figure, and even his critics will be forced to reckon with a man whose simple, rough-hewn appearance masks a subtle intellect and a keen grasp of perennial truths.The documentary was filmed on location in sites as varied as Athens, Rome, Paris, Auschwitz, Omaha Beach and Rev. Martin Luther King\u2019s jail cell in Birmingham Alabama.In each site, Robertson offers a message, underscoring Christianity\u2019s unique contribution to human history and civilization while also warning of the results when nations and societies detach themselves from belief in God.\u201cIn the absence of God,\u201d Robertson repeatedly intones, \u201cman becomes the determiner of all things.\u201dSpeaking within the framework of a biblically informed worldview, Robertson catalogs the consequences of sin and the rejection of God, resulting in wars, disease, hatred, corruption and death.Attempts to replace God with Nietzschean nihilism or social Darwinism reduce man to just one animal among many, Robertson cautions, resulting in the brutal ethics of survival of the fittest and an ideology of eugenics that undergirds organizations like Planned Parenthood.Robertson moreover rejects a false antagonism between Biblical belief and modern science, while also showing that science alone is woefully insufficient to explain the meaning and purpose of human existence.Showcasing the early years of Christianity, Robertson compares ancient Athens to Harvard Yard, while casting the Roman Empire as an early version of New York City. To this city of Rome, the apostles Peter and Paul came to spread the good news of the risen Christ, Robertson notes, and this is where they met their end as martyrs for that same faith.By abandoning and rejecting God, Robertson suggests, all civilizations are bound to decay and fall. \u201cA civilization\u2019s best chance of survival is to anchor itself in the God of creation.\u201dBringing this conviction to bear on American society, Robertson applauds the wisdom behind the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which understands rights and liberties to be grounded in God.\u201cThis link between human rights and belief in God is crucial,\u201d he proposes. Yet \u201cwhat happens when you strip away this belief in God as our Creator? What anchor do you have for human dignity and rights?\u201d he asks.Chronicling some of the worst atrocities in human history such as Robespierre\u2019s Reign of Terror and Hitler\u2019s Germany, Robertson concludes that \u201ctyranny is man\u2019s answer to anarchy,\u201d since \u201cboth come from godlessness.\u201d\u201cIn the absence of God, man becomes the sole determiner of human worth,\u201d he notes.Nietzsche\u2019s will to power means that \u201cthe man with the biggest stick determines who lives and who dies,\u201d he observes, which ultimately led to Auschwitz, an \u201cassembly line for mass murder.\u201dIn this sweeping look at history, Robertson even takes a swipe at modern utilitarian ethics. \u201cIf you live by the utilitarian belief in the greatest good for the greatest number of people,\u201d he asks, \u201cwhat happens when the majority decides it\u2019s the greatest good to kill all the Jews?\u201d\u201cFrom the guillotine to the gas chamber to the gulag, the story is the same,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cWhen you take out God as the anchor of your civilization you open the door to tyranny. Instead of human rights you have the will to power of the ruler who makes himself the sole determinant of what is true and just.\u201d\u201cWhen God is eliminated, human beings are no longer image-bearers; we are nothing more than \u2018the masses,\u2019\u201d he warns.Robertson\u2019s walk through history eventually leads to the present day, a crossroads that demands an honest look at where we are now, and hard decisions about where we are going.When society becomes self-absorbed and self-destructive, he cautions, it cannot forever endure. This is especially true when other violent forces hostile to Christianity and the West rise to destroy it, as can be seen in the escalation of Islamic extremism.As we reject the worldview that gave us Western civilization, \u201crooted in liberty and love,\u201d Robertson proposes, another worldview is rising to take its place, \u201crooted in dominance and submission, a death cult.\u201dAppropriately, the film poignantly ends with scenes of baptism in a river, suggesting that true conversion and going back to God may be the only hope for America\u2019s future.A return to God and to America\u2019s Christian roots may allow it once again to become a City on a Hill, to once again take its place in a dark world as \u201cTorchbearer.\u201d\u201cTorchbearer\u201d is coming to select theaters on October 7, to be followed by release on various digital and VOD platforms, including Comcast, Dish, iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, and more.

Any movement or intervention by Turkish forces during the military operations [to re-take Mosul] would be faced with a very strong response,\u201d he stated.Ankara has expressed an enthusiastic desire to participate in the liberations of both Mosul and Raqqa, Syria, the \u201ccapitals\u201d of the Islamic State in either country.\u00a0\u201cWe are ready to give all kinds of support in the fight against Daesh [ISIS] in Mosul,\u201d\u00a0Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said on Friday, referring to the troops currently stationed in Iraq, against the wishes of the Iraqi government.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in turn, has said that \u201cObama particularly wants to do something together [with us] about Raqqa.\u00a0We have told him that this is not a problem for us.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we have to show that we exist in the region. We do not have an option to step back at this point,\u201d Erdogan added, in statements last month.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said earlier this week that Turkey\u2019s presence could spark a \u201cregional war\u201d in Iraq, and the Foreign Minister referred to Turkish troops as a \u201chostile occupying force.\u201d Both nations summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors over the incident. Middle East Eye quotes\u00a0Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus dismissing Iraqi protests, arguing,\u00a0\u201cNo one has the right to object Turkey\u2019s presence in Iraq when the country is fragmented that much.\u201dIraq is currently divided among the Shiite government in Baghdad; the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in the north; the Islamic State in Mosul; and a variety of both Sunni and Shiite roving jihadist militias.The Shiite militias also told Middle East Eye that they will attack Turkish troops, with one leader saying, \u201cwe consider them an occupation force and we will deal with them on this basis.\u201dPrime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has called the Iraqi government\u2019s opposition to the Turkish presence in the country \u201cdangerous and provocative.\u201dTurkey insists its troops are in Iraq at the behest of the KRG in Erbil. \u201cIt is clear from the very beginning that the [President\u00a0Massoud]\u00a0Barzani administration\u00a0wanted the support of Turkish forces to train local forces to liberate Mosul,\u201d Turkish government spokesman Numan Kurtulmus said earlier this month. \u201cWe will not allow this to be a matter of debate.\u201d Al Monitor notes that the KRG has neither denied this nor enthusiastically embraced a Turkish presence in the region, stating only that they were aware of the troop deployment and did not object.While Turkey is currently embroiled in a conflict with the Syrian Kurdish militias, which it claims are a wing of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) terrorist group, it has enjoyed friendly relations with the Iraqi Kurdish government. Turkey fears that Syrian Kurdish groups will attempt to establish a sovereign Kurdistan using Turkish territory; a sovereign Kurdistan in modern-day Iraq would, on the other hand, not threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. The KRG has long opposed the PKK and requested it evacuate Iraq.The United Nations has weighed in on the conflict on behalf of Iraq. The Security Council \u2013 now led by Russia, an ally of Iran and Syria, the regional Shiite governments \u2013 issued a statement demanding Turkey respect \u201cthe principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference.\u201dTurkish-Russian diplomacy collapsed last year after the Russians repeatedly violated Turkey\u2019s territorial integrity, flying fighter jets meant to be targeting ISIS deep into Turkish airspace.Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have attempted to restore the bilateral relationship, however, and Putin will be traveling to Ankara on October 10.Middle East, National Security, Bashar al-Assad, Iran, Iraq, Islamic State, Mosul, Raqqa, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Shia militias, TurkeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Close to 7000 people have been arrested in Jammu and Kashmir since July 8, while more than 450 people have been booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA), a 1978 law considered highly restrictive. In addition, police sources say that 1500 others are under detention without any charges, and their detention doesn\u2019t reflect in the official records.Judging from Indian media, numbers like these are driving increased acceptance of the view that the continuing protests and violence in Kashmir are not being caused by Pakistan, but are \u201cindigenous\u201d and \u201corganic,\u201d meaning that it\u2019s coming from the people, rather than from the politicians.One Kashmir government spokesman, Nayeem Akhtar, compared the situation today to protests that occurred in 2010, which were purely political:[We are finding] ourselves in an unprecedented situation. \u2026There is a difference, lot of difference between 2010 and 2016. Like the local leadership apparently is not in control, the leadership has gone to 10 and 12 year old boys. Those who lead are driven by the street. In 2010, they could assert and bring it back. What we did (in 2010) is the role of opposition. I wish National Conference does the same but they have disappeared.\u201cNational Conference\u201d is a political party formed in 1947 with the objective of achieving Kashmiri independence from India through political means. Akhtar\u2019s point is that there is no longer political control of the protests, which are now being led by teenagers who weren\u2019t even around to protest in the past. It\u2019s this generational change that\u2019s caused a political protest to become a violent protest.Parvez Imroz, a rights activist in Kashmir supporting the separatists, also emphasizes a generational change:The government doesn\u2019t really know what to do and how to control protests.The state has become more vehement, firing bullets and pellets on unarmed people. But, despite all this use of force, people are organizing these protests well, which was not the case in the early 1990s. It was more of an emotional outburst back then. And many young people who are now on the streets have not seen the fear and terror that was instilled by the government forces in early 1990s.Now that element of fear is gone. \u2026The use of force against protesters is likely to continue. But one thing is certain \u2013 this uprising has given [a] new dimension to the resistance in Kashmir.The young generation is really controlling things on the streets.In [the] 1990s, and even till early 2000, some people from here would go and openly talk to the Indian government on behalf of people, but that can\u2019t happen now because people here have realized nothing comes out of these talks.But it remains to be seen how young people leading the protests will organize themselves and lead the struggle in the times ahead.From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this is how the world works. The 1947 Partition war between Muslims and Hindus was one of the bloodiest wars of the 20th century, so horrific that the survivors did everything they could to make sure that it never happens again. And the survivors were successful, as long as they were alive. But now they\u2019re pretty much all gone, and the young people rioting in Kashmir have no personal connection to the horrors of the Partition war, and they\u2019re ready, willing, anxious and able to risk having it happen again.As I  described in a recent article, India\u2019s last two generational crisis wars were India\u2019s 1857 Rebellion, which pitted India\u2019s Hindus against the British colonialists, and the 1947 Partition war, which pitted Hindus and Muslims against each other, following the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent into India and Pakistan. As we described in that article, the 1857 war led naturally to violence between Hindus and Muslims decades later, and then to the 1947 war.Now we\u2019re seeing that the 1947 war is leading, decades later, to new violence between Hindus and Muslims. Generational Dynamics predicts that we\u2019re seeing a kind of repeat of 1947, and that this increasing violence will lead to a new generational crisis war between Hindus and Muslims, and from there to full-scale war between Pakistan and India.

It removed the demand for an end to air strikes on\u00a0Aleppo and put the focus back on a failed Sept. 9 U.S./Russia ceasefire deal, which was annexed to the draft.British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin: \u201cThanks to your actions today, Syrians will continue to lose their lives in Aleppo and beyond to Russian and Syrian bombing. Please stop now.\u201dSyrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces, backed by Russian war planes and Iranian support, have been battling to capture eastern Aleppo, the rebel-held half of Syria\u2019s largest city, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped.\u201cRussia has become one of the chief purveyors of terror in Aleppo, using tactics more commonly associated with thugs than governments,\u201d U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations David Pressman told the council.He said Russia was \u201cintent on allowing the killing to continue and, indeed, participating in carrying it out\u201d and that what was needed from Moscow was \u201cless talk and more action from them to stop the slaughter.\u201dA U.N. resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes to be adopted. The veto powers are the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China. The Russian text only received four votes in favor, so a veto was not needed to block it.The French draft received 11 votes in favor, while China and Angola abstained. Venezuela joined Russia in voting against it.It was the fifth time Russia has used its veto on a U.N. resolution on Syria during the more than five-year conflict.The previous four times China backed Moscow in protecting Syria\u2019s government from council action, including vetoing a bid to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. China voted in favor of Russia\u2019s draft on Saturday.\u2018STRANGE SPECTACLE\u2019China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said some of the content of the French draft \u201cdoes not reflect the full respect for the sovereignty, independence, unification and territorial integrity of Syria,\u201d while the content of the Russian draft did.\u201cWe regret that the (Russian draft) resolution was not adopted,\u201d he told the council.Russia only gained the support of China, Venezuela and Egypt for its draft resolution. Angola and Uruguay abstained, while the remaining nine council members voted against.Churkin, who is council president for October, described the dual votes on Saturday as one of the \u201cstrangest spectacles in the history of the Security Council.\u201d\u201cGiven that the crisis in Syria is at a critical stage, when it is particularly important that there be a coordination of the political efforts of the international community, this waste of time is inadmissible,\u201d Churkin told the council.Syrian government forces recaptured territory from insurgents in several western areas on Saturday.Both the French and Russian U.N. draft resolutions called for a truce and humanitarian aid access throughout Syria.\u201cIf we don\u2019t so something this town (Aleppo) will soon just be in ruins and will remain in history as a town in which the inhabitants were abandoned to their executioners,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said. \u201cIf the international community does not wake up it will share the responsibility.\u201dThe council negotiated for a week on the text drafted by France. Russia circulated its own draft on Friday and said it would be put to a vote after the French text on Saturday.Angola\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins said his country abstained on both votes because it did not want to be drawn into the acrimony between the United States and Russia.The United States on Monday suspended talks with Russia on implementing a ceasefire deal in Syria, accusing Moscow of not living up to its commitments to halt fighting and ensure aid reached besieged communities.A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 sparked a civil war and Islamic State militants have used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq. Half of Syria\u2019s 22 million people have been uprooted and more than 400,000 killed.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Aleppo, Middle East diplomacy, Russia, Syria civil war, United NationsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Russians brought this on themselves.Mickey Wasp: \u201cIt is clear from this completely fraudulent article he has penned that Mr. X is not above composing lies in order to further the nefarious agenda of the Zionist criminal enterprise known as Israel and Warmongers of Congress and the CIA.Anyone who can write a line such as \u201cAfter years promising to help end the violence in Syria, Russian and Syrian warplanes have been indiscriminately attacking civilian neighborhoods and hospitals with barrel bombs, chemical weapons (chlorine gas), phosphorous bombs, cluster bombs and bunker bombs. It does not take rocket science to see that Russia and Syria have no intention of ending the violence.\u201d is not fit to call themselves a journalist or researcher or columnist, instead they should be labelled as a disgusting black propagandist and seen as working for those who created the conflict in Syria.\u201dAll of these things that I listed \u2014 attacking civilian neighborhoods and hospitals with barrel bombs, chemical weapons (chlorine gas), phosphorous bombs, cluster bombs and bunker bombs \u2014 have been widely reported in mainstream media and by government organizations in America, Europe, the Mideast and the United Nations. The only people saying that it\u2019s all made up are Russian and Syrian officials, as well as the army of paid Russian trolls.Related ArticlesScotster brightmoth: \u201cAmid the demonization of the Syrian government and leadership and the skillful use of social media by anti-government activists. Influenced by both mainstream and this alternative media, most people in the West do not know that Bashar al-Assad remains popular with many Syrians. Nor do they realize that Assad won an election two years ago.\u201dWhat the heck does that have to do with anything? Bashar al-Assad is being charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. What does it matter whether he won an election? Adolf Hitler won elections. Mao Zedong, Pol Pot and Josef Stalin were all very popular.There\u2019s a very important point here. It\u2019s the popularity of genocidal leaders that makes the genocidal acts possible. An unpopular leader could never get away with trying to exterminate an entire religious or ethnic group, as Bashar al-Assad is trying to exterminate the Sunni Muslims. A genocidal leader has to be popular to get away with his depraved acts. So when you talk about al-Assad\u2019s popularity, my response is that of course he\u2019s popular, and has to be to get away with committing genocide.Related ArticlesMickey Wasp: \u201cWe are experiencing the same demonization of Syria\u2019s al-Assad and Russia\u2019s Putin that we witnessed before those other two wars on Saddam and Gaddafi. Every possible allegation is made against them, often based on dubious and deceitful \u201cevidence,\u201d but it goes unchallenged because to question the propaganda opens a person to charges of being an \u201capologist\u201d or \u201cstooge\u201d or if they post on Xenakis articles, a Russia troll.\u201dIf it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck. You claim that you\u2019re a Texas redneck, but you quack like a Russian troll.There was a good example this last week of how Russian trolls work. A Dutch-led team announced the findings of a major investigation proving that Russians in eastern Ukraine in July 2014 shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 passenger plane with a Russian Buk 9M38 missile that was transported by a Volvo truck from Russia, and then transported back to Russia after it had been used to shoot down the plane.There are literally thousands of pieces of evidence, including intercepted phone calls, photos, analyzed and authenticated, videos, forensic examinations, witness statements, satellite images, and radar data. The amount of evidence is overwhelming.But the Russian trolls have been out in force saying that all the photos are photoshopped, and all the evidence was faked. And The Washington Post reports that numerous reporters have been targeted by Russian government hackers. I\u2019ve been targeted many times by both Russian and Chinese hackers. That\u2019s the game these Russian trolls play.So when this Russian troll says that \u201cevery possible allegation is made against [al-Assad and Putin], often based on dubious and deceitful \u2018evidence,'\u201d he\u2019s just being a good troll and saying the same things over and over despite overwhelming evidence. He should get an extra pay bonus from his trollmaster for being such a good troll.Here is another point worth making. I believe the truth of everything that I write. I have written about 4,000 articles on my web site since 2003, and every word is based on extensive research and reporting. I have an archive of some 85,000 articles that I have copied and pasted, and I add a dozen or so articles to the archive every day. I have to be sure of every fact, because if I make a mistake, then I know that people will pound on me for it.But that is not true of the Russian trolls. They know very well that Russians shot down the MH17 plane. They know very well that Bashar al-Assad is committing genocide. They know very well that Vladimir Putin is guilty of war crimes. But they\u2019re paid to lie, and they sell their souls every day to defend the greatest genocidal monsters of the 21st century so far.Guardian (London) and Washington PostRelated ArticlesJasmine16: \u201cPresident Assad wants to kill all Sunni Muslims? Come on. His wife is a Sunni. Many of his ministers and military officers are Sunnis. Many of his armed force officers are Sunnis. The majority of Syrian population prefer to live in government controlled areas. Even CIA and Qatar study reveal that 70% of Syrians-most of whom are (moderate) Sunnis, support him, while 20% are neutral, and only 10 % are against him. How on earth could the writer claims that the president wants \u201d \u2026 to massacre \u2026 all Sunni Muslim civilians \u2026.\u201d?\u201dThere is an extremely bloody historic fault line between Shia/Alawites (like Bashar al-Assad) and Sunnis. It is pretty clear that al-Assad wants to kill a large segment of Syria\u2019s civilian population, possibly millions of people, on the other side of that historic fault line, but there\u2019s a problem of how to characterize those people \u2014 what name should we give that group? Al-Assad just calls them all \u201cterrorists,\u201d but obviously children in a school or women and children in a marketplace slaughtered by an al-Assad airstrike are not \u201cterrorists\u201d in any meaningful sense. So in view of the historic hatred between Alawites and Sunnis, I use the characterization \u201cSunni Muslims\u201d as the most convenient way to describe the portion of the population that al-Assad wants to exterminate. It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s some kind of ethnic descriptor that could be used to make the characterization more precise, but I\u2019m not aware of one.TheLastConservative: \u201c\u2018In other words, it\u2019s just more bizarre garbage coming out of the mouths of Russian officials.\u2019 Which is a lot like #*&$ coming out of the State Department isn\u2019t it? There are no good guys in this situation. We are obviously too incompetent and should get out of it. We\u2019ve messed up enough as it is.\u201dA lot of people feel that way. But a lot more people feel that America has a moral obligation to be policeman of the world, so it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll get out of the situation.TheLastPlainsman: \u201cSo now that confuses me- what is your prediction then with a US/Russia conflict but then us still being allied in the next world war? Is there any kind of timeline to consider?\u201dRussia\u2019s historic enemies are the Turks, the Mongols, and particularly the Crimean Tatars. Russia has absolutely no reason to start a war with the West, as many people fear.As I\u2019ve been writing for many years, from the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Russia will be our ally in the coming Clash of Civilizations world war. Those who think that this is impossible should recall that the Soviet Union was our bitter enemy before and after World War II, but was our ally during World War II. Something like that will happen again. This prediction should make the Russian trolls very happy.Related ArticlesKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Russia, trolls, Syria, Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin\n Permanent web link to this article\n Receive daily World View columns by e-mailNational Security, Bashar al-Assad, Generational Dynamics, Russia, Syria, trolls, Vladimir PutinComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Inside the bomb, a Sunni and a Shi\u2019ite Muslim are seen lighting the fuses of bombs in order to blow each other up.The image conveys the message that Israel and the Jews are orchestrating Muslim infighting between Sunnis and Shi\u2019ites in order to destroy both groups.Breitbart Jerusalem, Jihad, National Security, anti-semitism, Cartoon, Fatah, glorifying terror, hate speech, Israel-Arab conflict, Jew-hatred, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian Terrorism, President Mahmoud Abbas, TerroristsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life\u2019s journey in the manner of my choice,\u201d he said.Two years ago, Archbishop Tutu reversed his lifelong opposition to assisted suicide, adding it to his list of progressive causes. The Archbishop has been criticized for his support of abortion and his willingness to lend his face to posters promoting the practice, as well as for his advocacy of gay marriage.In 1994, just as the Vatican was orchestrating a campaign against the United Nations\u2019 push for global \u201creproductive rights,\u201d including legal abortion worldwide, Tutu came out publicly in support of the UN platform.\u201cPlanned parenthood is an obligation of those who are Christians,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cOur church thinks we should use scientific methods that assist in planning of families.\u201dTutu has also been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights, and during the United Nation\u2019s launch of its \u201cFree & Equal\u201d campaign\u00a0in 2013, he said he would rather go to hell than to a \u201chomophobic heaven.\u201dThe Archbishop compared his advocacy for LGBT rights to his battle against apartheid, saying, \u201cI am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid. For me, it is at the same level.\u201dThe Anglican Church has been embroiled in a deep internal battle over the question of homosexual practice. Earlier this year, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.Traditional Anglicans, he said, \u201care walking into a well-rehearsed scheme to gradually apply persuasion, subtle blackmail, coercion on any group still standing with the Scriptural Provision as we know it, to join the straight jacket of the revisionists and be politically correct.\u201dFollow Thomas D.

Since it holds no prisoners to claim a swap deal, it will instigate tension around the [disputed territory of] Sheba Farms.\u201dThe official also said that the fact that Hezbollah fought on Russia\u2019s side will not be useful in any war that unfolds on Lebanese territory. \u201cAs long as Russian interests are unharmed and Israel restricts its retaliation to Lebanon, which is the likely scenario, nothing would affect Israeli-Russian relations, and certainly not lead to a Russian-Israeli confrontation.\u201dBig Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Aleppo, Hezbollah, islamic terrorism, Israel security, jihad, Lebanon, radical islam, Russian-Israeli confrontation, Syrian President Bashar al-AssadComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I mean, we had a very difficult 24 hours with the Iranians to finalize the prisoner trade.So, a number of things were going on. We wanted to get a lot of business done the same day. There were a number of documents signed on that final day. And so, that\u2019s really what happened that final day.Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mike Pompeo (R-KS) seem to think we still do not\u00a0have the full story on the Iran hostage deal. On Friday, they sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking for more information on the Justice Department\u2019s role in the cash payoff to Iran, asking exactly who approved tapping into the Treasury Department\u2019s Judgment Fund for the money.Noting the Attorney General is legally required to certify that payments from this fund are made \u201cin the interest of the United States,\u201d Rubio and Pompeo asked Lynch, \u201cPlease explain how sending billions of dollars in cash to the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism is in our country\u2019s best interest.\u201dThey also asked about a mysterious payment of $848k made even before the Iran nuclear deal was signed, a payment approved by Lynch.Middle East, National Security, Obama, Brett McGurk, hostages, Iran, Iran ransom payment, loretta lynch, State DepartmentComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

According to police, the victim asked the suspect, with whom she had a protracted relationship, to marry her.During a quarrel that ensued, he allegedly killed her and fled the scene.

October 10th will mark the 71st anniversary of the founding of North Korea\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, which would seem an auspicious moment for a headline-grabbing, world-defying nuclear test.Reuters notes that, while South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry sees no indications of an imminent test, the Yonhap news agency \u201ccited an unidentified government official that there was activity at the North\u2019s rocket launch station near the west coast that could be preparations for a long-range missile launch.\u201dThe South Korean official said \u201cchances are high that the North will conduct its sixth nuclear detonation or test-fire a ballistic missile ahead of the anniversary of its ruling Workers\u2019 Party and the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) scheduled in the US later this month,\u201d according to Sky News.Japan Times\u00a0reports that Tokyo is also carefully watching North Korea\u2019s test sites for either nuclear or ballistic-missile tests coinciding with the Workers\u2019 Party anniversary, as well as upcoming U.S.-South Korean naval drills. Defense Minister Tomomi Inada warned that \u201canother act of provocation cannot be ruled out.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s rhetoric has been getting a bit more explosive in the run-up to October 10th, with a statement from Pyongyang on Thursday declaring that America and her allies will soon face a \u201cshuddering reality,\u201d and denouncing the Obama administration as \u201crogues\u201d for imposing sanctions, such as the Treasury Department\u2019s recent action against a Chinese industrial firm for working with a banned North Korean company.China is always a big player in stories about North Korea, and if Professor Zhe Sun of the China initiative at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs is right, Beijing is running out of patience with its unruly client on the Korean peninsula.\u201cSome Chinese scholars and policy makers began to talk about supporting \u2018surgical strikes\u2019 and \u2018decapitation\u2019 by the U.S. and South Korea as one policy option\u2026\u00a0More radical proposals indicate that China should change the leader, send troops across borders and station in DPRK, force DPRK into giving up nuclear and beginning opening up and reforming,\u201d said the professor at a security forum in Washington on Thursday, according to a report at\u00a0Korea Times.He added that Beijing\u00a0remains interested in maintaining the \u201cstability of the North Korean regime, expressed in the \u20183 Nos policy (no war, no nuclear, and no chaos,\u201d and is still very nervous about the consequences of a North Korean collapse but is beginning to wonder \u201chow big of a price China should pay for supporting the Kim Jong-un regime.\u201dNational Security, ballistic missile, China, Japan, North Korea, nuclear test, south koreaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

For me it is very difficult to say, but yes,\u201d Betancourt told a French television network on Friday, asked directly whether \u201cthose who abducted you also deserve to have received the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201dBetancourt added that she was \u201cvery, very, very happy\u201d to see Santos win the award as it will \u201cinvite a moment of reflection in Colombia, of hope for peace, of the happiest to tell us that there is no turning back on peace.\u201dOf Santos in particular, she said he had \u201cstruggled practically on his own to obtain that result [a peace deal], he is changing the history of the country because he is giving new generations of Colombians the possibility of [living in] a different country.\u201dBetancourt was abducted in 2002 while she was campaigning during her presidential campaign as a member of a party she founded, the left-leaning Green Oxygen party. She spent six years in captivity and was freed in 2008 by a military operation ordered by then-president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who is currently a senator and the most prominent voice against the FARC peace deal. Santos was Uribe\u2019s Defense Minister at the time and had a leadership role in organizing the operation.While Betancourt initially emerged as a heroine from the ordeal, accounts written later by hostages who had to share quarters with her in the Colombian jungle painted an unsavory picture of a crass egotist who used her fame to secure better treatment from the terrorists.\u00a0\u201cI watched her try to take over the camp with an arrogance that was out of control. Some of the guards treated us better than she did,\u201d\u00a0Keith Stansell, an American Marine who was abducted and lived with the same set of hostages as Betancourt, said of her. He and two other Americans kept in her quarters later wrote a book in which they accused her of stealing food from other hostages and turning the terrorists against them by insisting they were CIA operatives.Betancourt has said that Uribe\u2019s opposition to Santos\u2019s peace deal is \u201ca matter of egos\u201d and not a legitimate concern regarding the leniency of the agreement towards the terrorists.Santos received the award on Friday in recognition of years of attempting to broker a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Marxist terrorist group that has operated in Colombia for the past half century. The FARC are the wealthiest non-jihadist terrorist group in the world, thanks to their extensive cocaine-smuggling operation, and its members have committed a wide array of crimes,\u00a0including but not limited to kidnapping, murder, rape, the use of child soldiers, forced abortions for child soldiers used as sex slaves, and drug trafficking.At least 220,000 people have died since the FARC was founded, and another 100,000 remain missing.Santos and FARC leader \u201cTimochenko\u201d signed a deal that would have allowed the FARC to establish a political party, launching themselves as candidates for office. They would have also been given representation in Congress without being elected, and most FARC terrorists would not have had to serve prison sentences. FARC terrorists would have had to hand themselves over to police and a tribunal made up partially of other FARC terrorists for sentencing.The Colombian people voted down this referendum last weekend, with the country\u2019s rural interior \u2014 the area most affected by terrorism \u2014 leading the \u201cno\u201d vote.National Security, Alvaro Uribe, Colombia, FARC, Ingrid Betancourt, Juan Manuel Santos, Latin America, Marxism, Nobel Peace PrizeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He said he might,\u201d Abella told reporters when asked what the president meant when he mentioned cutting ties with the U.S.More than 3,600 people have been killed in the Philippines since Duterte was inaugurated as president and initiated his war on drugs and crime.The White House has denounced the drug-war related deaths as extrajudicial killings, prompting Duterte to insult President Barack Obama.In late September, Duterte said he has decided to \u201ccross the Rubicon\u201d in his ties with the United States and will open trade alliances and offer long-term land leases to \u201cthe other side of the ideological barrier,\u201d China and Russia.Duterte did note he is not seeking to establish a military relationship with China and Russia.Nevertheless, the Filipino leader said that he told Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during a meeting last month, \u201cI would need your help in everything \u2014 trade, commerce \u2014 and I will open up.\u201dHe noted that the problem was that Manila\u2019s mutual defense treaty with Washington does not guarantee that the U.S. will come to the Philippines\u2019 defense if it is attacked given that the American President would need Congress\u2019 approval to make a move.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said earlier this week that the U.S.-Philippine alliance remains \u201cdeep and strong,\u201d adding \u201cthat the United States has not received any official requests from President Duterte or any other Filipino officials to alter any aspects of our bilateral cooperation.\u201dThe Philippines and China have been engaged in a territorial dispute over the South China Sea.Washington has taken no official position on the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, drawing ire from the Philippines.Despite the Philippines military alliance with the United States, the Filipino military remains incapable of addressing security threats that stem from the maritime disputes in the South China Sea, noted Duterte\u2019s top diplomat Yasay.\u201cWorse is that our only ally could not give us the assurance that in taking a hard line towards the enforcement of our sovereignty rights under international law, it will promptly come to our defense under our existing military treaty and agreements,\u201d the Foreign Affairs chief declared.India, Pakistan, and China have competing claims in the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, but Beijing has stayed in the shadows of the recent dispute between the other two countries.Nevertheless, China also holds joint military exercises with its neighbor India, which has been strengthening its military ties with the U.S. as well, given its wariness of Beijing\u2019s relationship with Pakistan and its growing military.National Security, China, India, Kashmir, Pakistan, Russia, South China Sea, united statesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In fact, the Shiites make up fully\u00a0half\u00a0of Assad\u2019s ground forces in the area.Assad, and most of the Syrian ruling elite, are members of the Alawite sect of Shia Islam, and Assad is strongly aligned with the dominant Shiite power, Iran. Syria is a Sunni-majority nation. Iraq is also beset by sectarian problems, including fears that Shiite militia groups are extending Iran\u2019s unhealthy influence in the country. Of course, the previous Sunni-dominated government of Saddam Hussein\u00a0is not remembered fondly by Iraqi Shiites, who comprise a slight majority of the national population.The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0notes that Iraqi Shiite forces are fighting alongside Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Hezbollah militia from Lebanon, and even Afghan Shiite troops in Aleppo, filling in the manpower gaps created by Assad\u2019s defeats and defections in earlier years of the Syrian civil war.Iraqi Shiite militia commander Hashem al-Mosawwi is quoted by the\u00a0Journal\u00a0describing Sunni opposition groups in Iraq as \u201cterrorists\u201d who \u201ccause all problems in the region and the world,\u201d and therefore \u201cmust be stopped.\u201dThe Obama administration, unsurprisingly, had no official response to this description of its soon-to-be-massacred allies in Syria.As the WSJ points out, Iraq\u2019s Shiite fighters theoretically have more pressing concerns in Mosul, where a massive operation to clear out the Islamic State has been brewing for the past year.However, the\u00a0Journal\u00a0says Shiite militias are \u201cexpected to play only a marginal role in the battle for Mosul, despite having successfully led some battles to evict Islamic State from Iraqi cities and towns, including Sunni-majority areas such as Tikrit.\u201dThis will come as a relief to Turkey, which wants to play a major role in the liberation of Mosul, in part because it sees itself as the guardian of Sunni Muslims.Turkish Prime Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Friday said that the \u201cgreatest danger for the Sunni population\u201d in Mosul was \u201cbeing forced to choose between Shiite militias and Daesh.\u201d Daesh is another name for ISIS.The Iraqi government has been complaining about the presence of Turkish troops on its soil, and Shiite militia leaders have flatly threatened to attack the Turks once the Battle of Mosul begins. There will be some allied commanders in the region who are relieved at the prospect of Shiite fighters heading off to fight in Syria, thus reducing the odds of a sectarian bloodbath when Mosul is recaptured from the Islamic State.Jihad, Middle East, National Security, alawite, Aleppo, bashar assad, Iran, Iraq, Mosul, Shiite, Sunni, Syria, TurkeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But it is likely to abandon the plan because of strong resistance from Somalia\u2019s government and border communities.In recent years, al-Shabab has been targeting Christians in Somalia and Kenya in an effort to push them out of areas they consider to be Muslim-only regions.BBC acknowledges:In December 2014, al-Shabab killed 38 non-Muslims at a quarry after separating them from Muslim workers. A few months earlier, 28 people were killed after Muslim passengers were split up from the other passengers.The Kenyan government has reportedly been recruiting Muslims to become police officers, a strategy that has had some success in reducing attacks by al-Shabab.Near the Somali border in northeastern Kenya, Muslims \u201cincreasingly see al-Shabab as a threat to their own interests, and are making a concerted effort to improve relations with Christians living there,\u201d reports BBC.\u201cMany of the Christians are skilled workers from other parts of Kenya, making a vital contribution to hospitals and schools,\u201d it adds. \u201cThe north-east is one of Kenya\u2019s poorest areas and if they are driven out public services will worsen.\u201dIn 2014, al-Shabab was responsible for the third-most terrorist attacks in the world. The U.S. military has carried several airstrikes against the group this year.Pressure from the Kenyan military, backed by its Somali counterpart, has been pushing al-Shabab militants into Kenya from Somalia. The Kenyan military is part of the African Union mission combating the group in Somalia.In October 2011, Kenyan troops entered Somalia to combat the jihadist group. Earlier this year, Kenya decided to shut down the Dadaab refugee camp, considered to be the world\u2019s largest, because it had become a recruitment center of al-Shabab.Kenya has accused the terrorist group of using the camp as a base to launch attacks on Kenyan soil.Jihad, National Security, Africa, Al Qaeda, al-Shabab, Christians, Kenya, SomaliaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Fifteen years to the day since the war in Afghanistan started, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) points out that the limited number of American troops in Afghanistan are being sent into battle with Afghan troops, who are supposed to be in the lead of security operations, but may prove to\u00a0not exist, severely limiting the number of actual troops on the ground.The Pentagon refused to comment on whether the Obama administration is concerned about \u201cghost\u201d Afghan troops receiving U.S. taxpayer funds, jeopardizing U.S. gains, and placing American military troops at risk. It would not say whether any American troops have been killed our wounded as a result of going into battle with nonexistent backing.\u201cPersistent reports indicating discrepancies between the assigned force strength of the ANDSF and the actual number of personnel serving raise questions regarding whether the U.S. government is taking adequate steps to prevent taxpayer funds from being spent on so-called \u2018ghost\u2019 soldiers,\u201d wrote the watchdog agency.\u201cNeither the United States nor our Afghan allies truly know how many Afghan soldiers and police are available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capability,\u201d SIGAR told lawmakers in April 2015.Inaccurate and unreliable data on Afghan security personnel may place America\u2019s security and billions of U.S. taxpayer funds at risk, pointed out SIGAR in April 2015, noting that the United States has spent nearly $70 billion to recruit, train, equip, house, feed, supply, and pay the salaries of the ANDSF, including those of \u201chollow\u201d Afghan brigades that do not really exist.In an August 5 letter addressed to U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and made public on Friday, the 15th year anniversary of the Afghanistan war, the U.S. Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), an oversight agency appointed by Congress, noted:U.S. Forces-Afghanistan reported that in the quarter ending June 2016 \u2018ANDSF assigned force strength was 319,595 (not including civilians).\u2019However, the Associated Press [AP] previously reported an Afghan official as indicating that \u2018the best internal estimate put the number around 120,000, less than a third of what is needed to secure the country.\u201dThat means that about 200,000 (319,565-120,000), or about two-thirds, of the total number of Afghan security forces are not accounted for and considered \u201cghost\u201d troops. The Pentagon would neither\u00a0confirm nor deny the 200,000 figure.President Barack Obama has drastically reduced the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan, driving American troops to intensify their reliance on their Afghan counterparts.SIGAR has been sounding the alarm about the Obama administration not knowing how many ANDSF troops \u201cactually exist.\u201dAt the end of April 2016, the watchdog group reported:For years, the authorized [end] strength of the ANDSF has been 352,000 soldiers and police. The ANDSF\u2019s reported actual strength has at times approached that goal, but never reached it. More troubling is SIGAR\u2019s assessment that neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities.SIGAR has blamed the lack of accurate and reliable personnel information on the Obama administration transferring oversight of the ANDSF to the Afghan government, which is plagued with corruption.The U.S. continues to rely on Afghan reporting on unit strengths, a concern for SIGAR because the rolls may contain thousands of \u2018ghost\u2019 personnel whose non-existence distorts realistic assessments of Afghan capabilities.In the letter, the watchdog agency noted:DOD [U.S. Department of Defense] is working to automate and centralize systems across the ANDSF, as well as to develop biometric procedures to better track soldiers and police\u2026In addition, DOD continues to place financial controls on U.S. funds provided to the ANDSF through a series of financial commitment letters with the Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the Ministry of Interior (MOI). These letters establish expectations for the responsible management of ANDSF funds and conditions under which funding can be withheld if these expectations are not met.Jihad, National Security, Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, Afghanistan, ANDSF, SIGAR, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan ReconstructionComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

As Brim explains:Crane has recently been the subject of numerous media interviews as \u201cThe Third Man\u201d in the new book Bravehearts: Whistleblowing in the Age of Snowden, a defense of Edward Snowden\u2019s theft of classified documents from the U.S., UK and Australia. John Crane was quietly removed from his Inspector General and whistleblower office positions in February 2013, four months before the Edward Snowden case became public knowledge. \u00a0He immediately became a consultant for the General Accountability Project (GAP), the legal counsel for Snowden. GAP was founded in 1977 by the extreme far left Institute for Policy Studies.[\u2026] Crane\u2019s allegations against the DoD in Bravehearts have been cited as a vindication of Snowden\u2019s acts by the Intercept, the website of Snowden advocate Glenn Greenwald (\u201cVindication for Edward Snowden From a New Player in NSA Whistleblowing Saga\u201d).He was suspended from his job as Defense Department Assistant Inspector General in 2013, accompanied by the loss of his security clearances, but is now appealing for reinstatement. This means Crane will have to complete a new security clearance questionnaire, Form SF 86, which now asks about the affiliation of relatives with any \u201cforeign government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence service.\u201d This is where the elder Crane\u2019s relationship with Islamist groups could enter the picture.The problem is that the Muslim Brotherhood might not be as problematic as it should be. The Obama Administration has labored mightily to rehabilitate the group\u2019s image, but Brim lays out a convincing case that it is exactly the kind of \u201cforeign movement\u201d our guardians of national security should worry about. It is already been designated a terrorist organization by a number of U.S. allies (plus Russia), and will obtain that designation in the United States if the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act of 2015 is enacted.Brim recalls the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s motto \u2013 \u201cAllah is our objective; the Prophet is our leader; the Quran is our law; Jihad is our way; dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope\u201d \u2013 and notes their determination to \u201cimpose strict Islamic law in Muslim-majority countries and the world, using a mix of politics and violence.\u201d They have ideological ties to some of America\u2019s worst non-state enemies, including Hamas, al-Qaeda, and by extension, the Islamic State.And yet, there does not seem to have been any effort made by this Administration, or its predecessors, to explore Robert Crane\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood ties, or the possibility that they might compromise his son. CounterJihad\u2019s exhaustive investigation ended with picking up the phone, calling John Crane, and asking if his father was that Robert Crane. He answered in the affirmative, but based on Brim\u2019s report, no one in the U.S. government bothered to ask.Robert Crane, who did not respond to an interview request from CounterJihad, has a lively resume, explored in detail by CounterJihad. He was, for example, appointed Deputy Director for National Security Planning by Richard Nixon, and then fired by Henry Kissinger; his connections in the Gulf Arab states made him Ronald Reagan\u2019s choice for ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, but his appointment was scuttled by Secretary of State Alexander Haig. Brim writes of Robert Crane\u2019s conversion to Islam:In 1980 Crane \u201cbecame Muslim after seeing Sudanese leader Hasan al-Turabi preach and pray at an Islamic affairs conference in New Hampshire\u201d (a variation on the conversion anecdote here). That Robert Crane would credit Hasan al-Turabi for his conversion is both surprising and concerning. Hasan al-Turabi became a leader of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood starting in the 1960s, was best known for inviting Osama Bin Laden to shelter his entire operation in Sudan from 1991-1996 and according to Human Rights Watch, imposed brutal sharia law as head of the National Islamic Front (the Muslim Brotherhood party) and in high office as Minister of Justice starting in 1979.\u00a0Brim relates many disturbing activities conducted by the organizations on Robert Crane\u2019s resume, but the central question would be how much any of it reflects on his son John Crane. Brim\u2019s antennae went up when the authors of the Bravehearts book about Snowden devoted a paragraph to Robert Crane, without naming him, or saying a single word about what he did after his spell with the Nixon Administration. Crane told Brim the authors did not ask about his father\u2019s conversion to Islam or ties to extremist groups, and he did not volunteer the information \u2013 which seems to be a fair summary of his relationship with U.S. intelligence as well.\u201cIf Crane undergoes a new background investigation, what answer will he give regarding his father\u2019s affiliations to a foreign movement? Will it be the factual one, or the whitewashed one he provided for Bravehearts: Whistleblowing in the Age of Snowden? Would a factual answer bar a return to his old position \u2013 or facilitate it, in a future administration that may actively support the Muslim Brotherhood?\u201d Brim asks.Similar questions could be asked about Huma Abedin, whose family journal, where she is listed as an assistant editor, has advocated some disturbing interpretations of Islamic law, as well as accusing the United States of inviting the 9/11 attack by heaping \u201cvarious kinds of injustices and sanctions\u201d upon the Muslim world. Her mother is an official in a group chaired by the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s leader, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Her father founded an institute supported by a major Muslim Brotherhood splinter group.Questions about Abedin are never answered. They are deflected by furious allegations of conspiracy-mongering and anti-Muslim bigotry. Hillary Clinton and her top aides are clearly above the law, and above all reasonable\u00a0national security scrutiny.Crane does not have the magical Clinton immunity, but as Brim pointed out, the Muslim Brotherhood certainly has not been shunned by the Obama Administration, and it is poised to do even better in Washington if Hillary Clinton becomes President. The current climate of political correctness treats very few Islamic organizations as security risks, unless they\u2019ve been directly classified as terrorist organizations under American law. The web of connections between hardcore Islamists and more \u201cmainstream\u201d groups is complicated, making it easy to caricature discussion of those links as \u201cconspiracy-mongering.\u201d The groups cluttering these complex flowcharts tend to have the word \u201cMuslim\u201d in their benevolent-sounding names, and that\u2019s all the dominant political culture in Washington needs to see before averting its eyes.It\u2019s fair to ask whether someone like John Crane has been unduly influenced by his father, or might compromise sensitive information by talking to him. The answer to that question could be \u201cno.\u201d It is terrifying beyond belief to consider that no one at the Defense Department had the desire, or maybe the courage, to ask.Jihad, National Security, Edward Snowden, Hillary Clinton, human abedin, Islam, Islamist, Muslim BrotherhoodComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Before, families could tell police that they forgive the murderers, and thus bar law enforcement from prosecuting the case. Before 2005, men who killed a female relative could use this provision to pardon themselves, as they were considered members of the family.Parents still retain one veto over the court system, however: if a murderer is sentenced to the death penalty, the family of the victim may forgive them, triggering a 12.5-year \u201clife sentence\u201d instead of capital punishment.The rape of minors and disabled individuals who do not have the ability to consent was previously not a crime in Pakistan. Most cases also suffered from a lack of evidence, as DNA testing was not mandatory. The Pakistani newspaper\u00a0Dawn notes that this set of circumstances has resulted in rape conviction rates at \u201cclose to zero percent, largely due to the law\u2019s reliance on circumstantial evidence and a lack of forensic testing.\u201dThe new mandatory minimum sentence in a rape case is 25 years.The bill faced some opposition in the legislature. Rather than argue against the bill, one representative argued against debating bills at all, blaming India and \u201cthe Jewish agenda\u201d for the smooth operation of the legislature on Thursday.\u201cThis Parliament has been subdued by the American NGOs and their Jewish agenda, which is against Pakistan,\u201d\u00a0Dawn says in a summary of his statements. \u201cHe also lamented that \u2018today even 5th graders are aware of sex education.\u2019\u201dPakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif celebrated the bill.\u00a0\u201cWomen are the most essential part of our society and I believe in their empowerment, protection and emancipation so that they can equally contribute towards development and prosperity of our country,\u201d he said in a statement\u00a0following its passage.Qandeel Baloch gained international acclaim for daring to defy strict Islamic norms of how women should behave. Dubbed \u201cPakistan\u2019s Kim Kardashian\u201d for her posts on social media \u2013 tame by Western standards, but scandalous in Pakistan \u2013 Baloch began her career by posting photos of herself online, but rapidly began to advocate for female independence and against the imposition of traditional Islamic values on women.Baloch drew controversy shortly before her death by meeting the cleric Mufti Abdul Qavi in a hotel room in June and taking a \u201cselfie\u201d photo with him. Qavi was demoted from his positions on various Islamic committees as a punishment for his inappropriate meeting with the Internet star. Baloch, meanwhile, said on her Facebook page that she had seen Qavi enjoy a soda in her presence \u2013 during the day, during the Ramadan fast \u2013 and that he had made sexual advances towards her, which she rejected.She immediately began receiving death threats and asked Pakistani police for further security.In July, her brother Waseem strangled her. She was 26.\u201cI am proud of what I did,\u201d Waseem told the press after his arrest. \u201cGirls are born to stay home and follow traditions. My sister never did that.\u201dBaloch\u2019s mother told the media her son had spoken to Qavi after the incident, and she believed the cleric encouraged Waseem to kill his sister.Baloch\u2019s parents have refused to forgive their son, which would absolve him of any crime. As a result, they have faced significant pressure from their community. As Qandeel was the only member of the family generating any income, the septuagenarians are now homeless, the father ill with tuberculosis and missing a leg. None of their seven sons have come to their aid after Qandeel\u2019s murder.The Pakistani newspaper\u00a0Dawn\u00a0has published a column condemning such community pressure and urging the legislature to act not only against those who physically murder, but enablers, as well, to prevent not only murders, but suicides:The girls who become victims of these crimes are the bravest and sturdiest of the lot.Far greater numbers kill themselves out of hopelessness and haplessness, driven to death by the oppressive demands of the men who they know can and will kill them.Their deaths are not counted in the numbers of honour crimes, fractional figures of a reality too grim to count.National Security, honor killings, Islam, Pakistan, Qandeel Baloch, radical islamComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Most claim to have attended secondary school and a large fraction have gone on to study at university,\u201d said the study, titled Economic and Social Inclusion to Prevent Violent Extremism.\u201cWe find that Daesh [ISIS] did not recruit its foreign workforce among the poor and less educated, but rather the opposite. Instead, the lack of economic inclusion seems to explain the extent of radicalization into violent extremism,\u201d it adds.According to the World Bank study, of 331\u00a0recruits identified in a leaked Islamic State\u00a0database, only 17 percent did not finish high school, and a quarter had a university-level education, while \u201c15% left school before high school and less than 2% are illiterate.\u201d\u201cA large fraction [of recruits] have gone on to study at university. \u2026 Recruits from Africa, south and east Asia and the Middle East are significantly more educated than individuals from their cohort in their region of origin,\u201d said the report.When asked by the Islamic State\u00a0what role they hoped to play within the terrorist group, the number of those who aspired to be administrators and \u201csuicide fighters\u201d increased with education, noted the study.The report found that neither inequality nor poverty drove Muslims to engage in violent extremism. In fact, wealthier nations were likelier to supply foreign recruits willing to fight for the Islamic State.\u201cIn countries with a large Muslim population, low degrees of religiosity, low levels of trust in religious institutions and strong government and social control of religion seem to be risk factors of radicalization,\u201d the report determined.\u201cThe research, based on internal records from the Islamic State group, will reinforce the growing conclusion among specialists that there is no obvious link between poverty or educational levels and radicalization,\u201d reports the Guardian.Some analysts have been disseminating the notion that the Islamic State\u00a0is likely to attract poor Muslims with a low level education to join their cause. At one point, the Obama administration blamed poverty for the growth of the terrorist group.Earlier this year, news reports emerged saying that, in Pakistan, the Islamic State\u00a0was attracting recruits from the educated upper-class, which is consistent with the World Bank study findings.\u201cPolicies that promote job creation, therefore, not only benefit young people seeking jobs but may help thwart the spread of violent extremism and its attendant effects on national and regional economic growth,\u201d the World Bank researchers noted.The study was gleaned from data leaked by a disaffected former Islamic State\u00a0member in March that includes basic information on 3,083 foreign recruits from all over the Muslim world and Europe, who joined the terrorists group between early 2013 and late 2014, when the flow of fighters to the organization reached a peak.Once the fighters arrived in Islamic State-held territory, they were vetted and interviewed, a move that resulted in the recording of data on country of residence, citizenship, marital status, skills, educational status, previous extremist experience, and knowledge of Islamic law.\u201cOngoing research into causes of Islamic militancy has underlined the complexity of motives of recruits and volunteers, as well as the differences between different conflict zones,\u201d points out the Guardian.Jihad, National Security, Daesh, IS, ISIL, ISIS, Islamic State, Jihadi recruits, World BankComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The committee said in their announcement Santos deserved the award for \u201chis resolute efforts to bring the country\u2019s more than 50-year-long civil war to an end, a war that has cost the lives of at least 220,000 Colombians and displaced close to six million people.\u201d The committee notes that the award is as much for the Colombian people \u2013 who have endured a half century of being terrorized by the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) \u2013 as for Santos himself, and explicitly does not reward the other half of the peace negotiations, FARC terrorist leader \u201cTimochenko\u201d and his chief negotiators.The announcement also addresses the fact that the Colombian people rejected the peace deal \u2013 one that would have allowed most FARC terrorists to avoid prison sentences and FARC leaders to establish a political party, possibly funded with drug trafficking profits.\u201cThe fact that a majority of the voters said no to the peace accord does not necessarily mean that the peace process is dead. The referendum was not a vote for or against peace,\u201d the committee said, encouraging further negotiations between the FARC and the representatives of their victims:By awarding this year\u2019s Peace Prize to President Juan Manuel Santos, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to encourage all those who are striving to achieve peace, reconciliation and justice in Colombia. The president himself has made it clear that he will continue to work for peace right up until his very last day in office. The Committee hopes that the Peace Prize will give him strength to succeed in this demanding task.Santos accepted the award in a speech this morning \u201cin the name of all Colombians, especially the victims of this conflict we have suffered for 50 years.\u201d The award, he said, would be an impetus to \u201cbegin to construct a stable and durable peace\u2026 so that there will not be a single new victim, a single new death.\u201dWith a less than one percent difference, the Colombian people voted \u201cno\u201d to the peace deal Santos brokered with Timochenko, signed in Havana, where the communist Cuban government has provided safe haven to FARC terrorists for years. The deal would have given all FARC terrorists 90 days to disarm and hand themselves over to a special tribunal, staffed partially by FARC terrorists, which would have judged the crimes of all terrorists individually. Crimes would have been divided into two categories: \u201cpolitical crimes\u201d and \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d Only those found guilty of the latter would have served prison sentences, and the categories were never specifically defined. FARC terrorists would also be granted representation in the nation\u2019s Congress without being elected until 2018, when they could run their own candidates for office.The opposition to the deal, led by former president (and now Senator) \u00c1lvaro Uribe, argued that the deal was too lenient with terrorists that had plagued the countryside for decades and were heavily involved in the drug trade. On Univisi\u00f3n, another former president, Andr\u00e9s Pastrana, compared the deal to allowing Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel to establish a political party and granting Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n the same legitimacy as a head of state. Pastrana noted to host Jorge Ramos that he had been personally abducted by the FARC and had lost his father-in-law in a FARC kidnapping, and that his frustration with the deal was that of many FARC victims.The distribution of votes appears to support Pastrana: \u201cno\u201d won the mountainous interior of the country, with \u201cyes\u201d taking the coastal and urban areas that had suffered the FARC\u2019s reign of terror less directly. The deal lost in the village that saw the FARC born over 50 years ago and in FARC leader Timochenko\u2019s hometown.Uribe, who Santos has invited to the dialogue to construct a new peace deal, congratulated his former Defense Minister this morning:Felicito el Nobel para el Presidente Santos, deseo que conduzca a cambiar acuerdos da\u00f1inos para la democracia\u2014 \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez (@AlvaroUribeVel) October 7, 2016\u201cI congratulate President Santos on the Nobel, I hope he will work to change agreements that hurt democracy,\u201d he tweeted.The FARC have rejected the referendum, calling it \u201cnot legally viable\u201d as both Santos and Timochenko signed the agreement. The Colombian Constitution mandates the approval of the people for such an agreement to be valid, however; Uribe and his supporters argue that Timochenko\u2019s proposal to ignore the referendum entirely would be unconstitutional.The ceasefire between the FARC and the Colombian government will end on October 31 unless the parties sign a new peace deal.National Security, Colombia, communism, Cuba, FARC, Juan Manuel Santos, Latin America, Nobel Peace Prize, terrorismComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Xenakis7 Oct 20160This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nStaffan de Mistura (Reuters)Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy for Syria, gave a passionate speech on Thursday, where he practically begged both sides to stop the genocide going on in east Aleppo in Syria.De Mistura\u2019s point was that there are over 275,000 people in east Aleppo, but only about a thousand of them are members of Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Nusra Front) which recently renamed itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) when it cut its ties to al-Qaeda.De Mistura begged the al-Nusra fighters to leave the city, rather than to allow the destruction of Aleppo and the deaths of many of the 275,000 residents. Addressing himself directly to the al-Nusra fighters, de Mistura said:Can you please look at my eyes, and those of the Aleppo people. Of the 275,000 civilians that are there where you are, and confidently those 275,000 people that you\u2019re going to stay there, and that you remain there and keep hostage of your refusal to leave the city, because 1,000 of you are deciding on the destiny of 275,000 civilians. I would like you to reply to this question \u2014 not to me, but to those 275,000 people \u2014 and if you did decide to leave, in dignity, and with your weapons, to Idlib or anywhere you wanted to go, I personally am ready physically to accompany you.It is a very dramatic offer, but the probability that it will be taken up is pretty close to zero. Even if 1,000 fighters left the city, Syria and Russia would claim that there were still more \u201cterrorists.\u201d In the event that de Mistura played the part of a Pied Piper leading fighters out of Aleppo, it\u2019s even possible that Russian and Syrian warplanes would target him and kill him, and then say that it was Nato warplanes that killed him. Reuters and Asharq Al-AwsatRelated ArticlesRussia and Syria have repeatedly been accused of war crimes and genocide in recent days by United Nations officials, in reaction to Russian and Syrian warplanes indiscriminately attacking civilian neighborhoods and hospitals with barrel bombs, chemical weapons (chlorine gas), phosphorous bombs, cluster bombs and bunker bombs,UN envoy Staffan de Mistura renewed those accusations on Thursday by comparing the actions of Syria and Russia to the genocides at Srebrenica and Rwanda.He said that, unless there\u2019s a \u201cgame changer,\u201d the city of Aleppo will by \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d by Russia and Syria within 2 to 2 1/2 months, presumably killing most of the 275,000 residents, who are \u201ccivilians, not terrorists.\u201dDe Mistura said:There is only one thing that we are not ready to do \u2013 be passive, resignate ourselves to another Srebrenica, another Rwanda, which we are capable sadly today to recognize \u2013 written on that wall in front of us \u2013 unless something takes place.That doesn\u2019t mean that we will not \u2014 and we will \u2014 put this into context of a political process, because it\u2019s clear anything we do is not only about Aleppo is going to be also part of a political process that we will relaunch, we need to relaunch, we need a political horizon, based on what happens in the Security Council.Unless there is any major game changer that may change the equation, this cruel, constant use of military activities, bombing, fighting destruction in eastern Aleppo will continue. Let\u2019s be honest, there is nothing that tells us that it will not continue. \u2026The bottom line is \u2013 in maximum 2 months, 2 1/2 months the city of eastern Aleppo at this rate may be totally destroyed. We\u2019re talking about old city in particular. And thousands of Syrians \u2013 civilians, not terrorists \u2014 will be killed. And many of the wounded. And thousands and thousands of them may try to become refugees in order to escape from there.This is what you, we, the world will be seeing when we will be trying to celebrate Christmas, or the end of the year, if this continues at this rate, unimpeded. Homs [Syrian city] multiplied by 50.It is been very clear for a long time that the depraved psychopath Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, would very much like to see 275,000 residents of Aleppo killed, even though only all but a few thousand are innocent civilians. Syrian and Russian warplanes have been bombing hospitals, schools and civilian neighborhoods even in cities where al-Nusra was never present.So de Mistura\u2019s passionate plea has no possibility whatsoever of making a difference.At Friday\u2019s emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Russia will undoubtedly say that there more than just a few thousand of the 275,000 residents are \u201cterrorists.\u201d Russia may even claim that almost of the 275,000 residents are \u201cterrorists.\u201d AFP and BBCKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Staffan de Mistura, Russia, Aleppo, Syria, Bashar al-Assad, Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Nusra Front, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, JFS, Front for the Conquest of Syria\n Permanent web link to this article\n Receive daily World View columns by e-mailMiddle East, National Security, al-Nusra Front, Aleppo, Bashar al-Assad, Front for the Conquest of Syria, Generational Dynamics, Jabhat al-Nusra, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, JFS, Russia, Staffan de Mistura, SyriaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

There was insufficient time to decide whether to grant or reject these requests before the next scheduled hearing next Monday.The spokesman added bluntly that he couldn\u2019t understand why prosecutors would employ a legal tactic that left them open to charges they had \u201ctorpedoed the proceedings which they themselves had launched.\u201dThe charges against Zafke focus on a one-month period in 1944 when 14 trains carrying prisoners \u2014 including the teenage diarist Anne Frank \u2014 arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau.Frank, who arrived in Auschwitz with her parents and sister, was later transferred to another camp, Bergen-Belsen, where she died in March 1945, just two months before the Nazis were defeated.Thursday\u2019s announcement marked the end of a case that had been marred by five delays and at times deteriorated into farce, increasingly frustrating victims\u2019 lawyers.The International Auschwitz Committee, which represents Holocaust survivors, had sharply attacked Germany\u2019s handling of the case, saying the court was hurtling \u201cbetween sloppy ignorance and complete disinterest\u201d in a resolution.Some 1.1 million people, most of them European Jews, perished between 1940 and 1945 in Auschwitz before it was liberated by Soviet forces.More than 70 years after the prosecution of top Nazis began in Nuremberg, Germany has been racing against time to try the last Third Reich criminals.Zafke was the fourth former concentration camp worker in the dock in the latest series of trials, following John Demjanjuk in 2011, Oskar Groening in 2015 and Reinhold Hanning this May \u2014 all convicted of complicity in mass murder.Those cases were hailed for providing a degree of catharsis for aged survivors, even if they shed little new light on the Holocaust.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Auschwitz death camp, European Jews, final solution, Hubert Zafke, International Auschwitz Committee, Jewish Diaspora, Nazi-occupied Poland, Nazism, shoaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But the kingdom had the political will to protect children\u2019s rights, he said.The U.N. experts voiced deep concern that Riyadh \u201cstill does not recognise girls as full subjects of rights and continues to severely discriminate (against) them in law and practice and to impose on them a system of male guardianship\u201d.Traditional, religious or cultural attitudes should not be used to justify violations of their right to equality, they said.Children of Shi\u2019ite Muslim families and other religious minorities are persistently discriminated against in their access to schools and justice in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, they said.Children over 15 years are tried as adults and can be executed, \u201cafter trials falling short of guarantees of due process and a fair trial\u201d, the report said.Out of 47 people executed on Jan. 2, 2016 \u2013 the biggest mass execution for security offences in decades, that included a prominent Shi\u2019ite cleric, at least four were under 18 when sentenced to death, it said.The experts urged Saudi authorities to \u201crepeal all provisions contained in legislation which authorise the stoning, amputation and flogging of children\u201d.Saudi Arabia should \u201cunambiguously prohibit the use of solitary confinement, life sentences on children and child attendance of public execution\u201d.All forms of sexual abuse against children should be a crime and perpetrators prosecuted, the experts said.They cited the case of Muslim preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi, saying his charges were reduced and he was released from jail \u201cafter having raped, tortured and killed his five-year-old daughter\u201d in 2012.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Bandar Bin Mohammed Al-Aiban, Convention on the Rights of the Child, human rights, islamic law, Middle East justice, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Human Rights Commission, Sharia LawComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He said Abbas went through a number of routine tests, including a cardiac catheterization, a procedure that can detect and treat heart problems, and that everything looked normal.\u201cHis arteries look great, and there is no need for him to stay in the hospital,\u201d al-Batrawi said.Several hours later, Abbas walked out of the hospital, waving to well-wishers.Abbas did not comment when asked by reporters how he felt.

Everything is OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI leave the hospital with good health. Thanks to the medical team of the hospital.\u201dAbbas, who has a history of health issues, was elected president in 2005 for what was supposed to be a four-year term. But in 2007 the rival Hamas militant group seized control of the Gaza Strip, and Abbas has remained in power.The Palestinians are now divided between two governments, Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza. Attempts at reconciliation have repeatedly failed, and this week the Palestinians called off plans to hold municipal elections in the two territories.Abbas, who is a heavy smoker and is overweight, was treated years ago with prostate cancer and has had a stent inserted to treat artery blockage.He also is under great pressure as his popularity has plummeted. The Palestinian public is frustrated over years of failed peace efforts with Israel. Over the past week, he also has come under heavy criticism at home for attending the funeral of the late Israeli president, Shimon Peres.Over the years, Abbas has ignored calls to appoint a successor, setting the stage for a bitter power struggle if he is incapacitated.A long list of senior officials and security chiefs would likely covet the job, though there is no clear front-runner. Perhaps the most popular potential successor, Marwan Barghouti, is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison for his role in deadly attacks on Israelis. Hamas would also likely demand a say in choosing a new leader. Hamas had no immediate comment Thursday.Even choosing a caretaker leader ahead of future elections will be a difficult task. Under Palestinian law, the parliament speaker is supposed to take over if the president is incapacitated or dies. But the current speaker, Aziz Dweik, is a member of Hamas.Abbas\u2019s Fatah party has argued that since parliament has not functioned in nearly a decade, Dweik would not be eligible to lead the Palestinians.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Gaza Strip, Hamas, Mahmoud Abbas, Marwan Barghouti, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian territoriesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

A capital city is a Western concept, and the importance attributed to it is part of the modern conception of a state.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a state that has a seat in the United Nations, because it has artificial boundaries, while the Islamic state, the Islamic home, has to be portable, flexible and unbound by frontiers. The state, or the house, could govern at night and disappear during the day. That\u2019s what the Taliban do.\u201dAbu Katada added that fixed boundaries play into the hands of the enemy.\u201cThe Mujahideen need to square the circle, the state appears and disappears, governs at night and disappears during the day, the most important thing is to prevent the enemy from taking it over even if he invaded. We may not control some parts of the state, but it\u2019s paramount that we have the ability to hurt the enemy and prevent him from gaining a foothold on the ground.\u201dAbu Katada, who spent some years in a British prison for incitement to terror, said that the state \u201cshould not conform to Western standards, like those of the UN, the Arab League, the World Bank or the International Court of Justice. That would turn it into another Western state, and not an Islamic state that is governed according to God\u2019s criteria.\u201d\u201cThe modern state needs a capital city, international recognition, a currency, and I\u2019m afraid some Islamic organizations are seduced by these,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Islamic state or home don\u2019t need a capital city, they can exist in a small town or village, it doesn\u2019t need representation in the UN General Assembly nor does it need borders. Succumbing to your enemy\u2019s monetary system could allow him to inflict economic damage, even in the event of military gains. The state must be bouncy, unable to be controlled by the enemy.

Conversely, the organization has been accused of promoting Shia Islam as well as Iran\u2019s interests.Salem further said that, since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has treated Israel as an illegal entity and called on Muslims around the world to help the Palestinians liberate their land \u201cfrom the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea.\u201d\u201cAside from Allah, the Palestinian resistance owes its unprecedented strength at present to the determination of the Palestinian people and to Iran\u2019s support,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just quantity, it\u2019s quality as well,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen the Islamic Republic first became involved the Palestinian Resistance only had knives and stones.

Iran is unabashed about its support for the Palestinians, and says it will continue to give the Resistance whatever it can, and that its motivations are ideological, religious and Quranic.\u201d\u201cThe pressure applied on Iran results from its position on Palestine, not because of a nuclear program or anything else.

Pollak7 Oct 20160The reason was simple: the people of Colombia felt their leaders had given away too much to the terrorists, denying justice to the victims and creating incentives for future terror.But no one had listened\u00a0to them. The Obama administration, for example, was heavily invested in the peace deal\u00a0as part of its outreach to the Castro regime; Kerry even witnessed the signing of the deal last month.In the U.S., one of\u00a0the few voices\u00a0against the deal was\u00a0Wall Street Journal columnist Mary Anastasia O\u2019Grady, who warned that the deal was \u201cpractically a surrender\u201d:The deal gives the FARC amnesty for its war crimes, which include the recruitment of thousands of child soldiers, massacres of villages, political executions, bombings and kidnappings.Under the agreement, negotiated and signed in Havana, the FARC will also get unelected seats in Congress and special welfare benefits. It will be given dozens of radio stations\u2014so that it can disseminate its propaganda, a privilege no other political party has.The agreement does not require the FARC to pay any financial reparations to its victims, even though the narco-terrorist kingpins have wealth estimated in the billions. Reparations will be paid by law-abiding citizens via sharp tax increases. The FARC says it will not disarm until it\u2019s good and ready to. Meanwhile it will be given weapons and training to enforce the agreement.Colombians were also angry that\u00a0President Juan Manuel Santos had taken the peace agreement to the United Nations before securing the support of the people. He declared to the UN General Assembly last month: \u201cI return to the United Nations today, on the International Day of Peace, to announce with all the strength of my voice and my heart, that the war in Colombia has ended.\u201d (Update: Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.)Yet there are two ways to end a war \u2014 through victory, or surrender. Colombians rejected the latter.O\u2019Grady notes that the Colombian government resorted to a variety of illiberal methods\u00a0to campaign for\u00a0the peace deal, such as promising\u00a0to spend government funds in areas that voted \u201cyes.\u201d The government also warned that voting \u201cno\u201d meant returning to war.Never mind that the last Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, had pushed FARC back on the battlefield, and that the rebels were weakened as a result. His successor gave those hard-fought gains\u00a0away for nothing.Now the Colombian government will return to the negotiating table \u2014 strengthened, ironically, by the fact that the people have rejected more lenient terms brokered under Havana\u2019s watchful eye. The\u00a0cease-fire with FARC could end on October 31, but the people of Colombia have faced that risk, and decided that the\u00a0price of an illusory peace was even heavier.Theirs was an extraordinarily brave decision \u2014 especially since the regions\u00a0closest to the fighting led the nation in voting \u201cno.\u201dThe Colombian people were able to exercise a choice that the American people never had when it came to the Iran deal. A new Breitbart/Gravis poll released this week confirms that the voters still reject the deal.Americans know\u00a0Iran has no desire for peace, that\u00a0the agreement allows Iran to continue its nuclear weapons program in future years, and that\u00a0the regime will cheat. Americans have consistently rejected the deal \u2014\u00a0along with its grotesque side deals, including ransoms for hostages.The Constitution requires that all treaties be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. So the Obama administration, knowing that the Senate would reject the pathetically weak terms to which it had agreed, called the Iran deal an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201dThen Congress spoke up with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act,\u00a0demanding the power to reject the deal \u2014 while lowering the threshold for approval\u00a0to an effective one-third of either house, (which is why Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)\u00a0voted against it). That wasn\u2019t good enough for President Barack\u00a0Obama, who took the deal to the UN\u00a0Security Council first, then presented\u00a0Congress with a\u00a0fait accompli and dared it to risk war.In the end, Democrats filibustered, and there was no vote. The first time the American electorate will have a chance to speak out about the Iran deal is in the 2016 presidential election.Both Santos and Obama\u00a0sought to appease terrorism, using the UN\u00a0for\u00a0leverage against their own people. The big\u00a0difference is that Santos submitted his agreement to the voters, recognizing their sovereignty. Obama did not have the decency to do that, despite the clear intent of the Framers of the Constitution that the\u00a0people, through Congress, would decide war and peace.The recent Brexit vote did not quite involve life and death, but saw a similar pattern, where the \u201cremain\u201d campaign\u00a0tried to use\u00a0fears of economic collapse, and international leverage, to quash the voters\u2019 desire for greater sovereignty over Britain\u2019s borders and economic affairs.When treaties and transnational institutions are abused in such anti-democratic fashion, it is no surprise globalization has few defenders left, even though the benefits of (real) peace, and (truly) free trade, are\u00a0elementary.From Brexit, to the Iran deal, to \u201cpeace\u201d with\u00a0FARC, voters have been warned that rejecting the poor terms negotiated by their feckless leaders would mean disaster.The British and Colombian voters have spoken, bravely. Now, finally, Americans will have a turn.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

More details on the drill could be eventually released. This exercise will follow the earlier joint exercise that was conducted in February 2016\u2026These exercises are aimed at bringing peace and tranquillity to the region. The two countries are among the fastest growing economies in the world and have fought only one war, in 1962, when compared with the otherwise peaceful civilizational co-existence of these ancient civilizations.The news of the upcoming joint military exercise comes as clashes between nuclear armed India and Pakistan have escalated in the disputed and Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir.India, Pakistan, and China all have competing claims to the region. However, China has stayed out of the dispute between India and Pakistan.Although regional rivals Pakistan and India claim all of Kashmir, each of them only controls part of it. China maintains a relationship with both countries. It is one of India\u2019s most important trade partners.Meanwhile, TIME recently reported:Pakistan is angling itself toward China, the only country on the continent with a population, economy, and military that top India\u2019s.China has agreed to spend $46 billion in investment in Pakistan, which is also the world\u2019s largest recipient of weapons from China. China also builds Pakistan\u2019s nuclear reactors. These are ties that bind.India is reportedly concerned about China\u2019s growing military and its relationship with Pakistan.TIME notes:Indians are wary of China and seeking partners to balance China\u2019s growing clout. Some 48 percent of Indians say that China\u2019s relationship with Pakistan is a very serious problem; another 21 percent of Indians say it\u2019s somewhat serious. China\u2019s growing military power elicits roughly the same response from Indians, as well. Wariness of China has led India to strengthen ties with the U.S. and other Asian countries.China and the United States are at odds over Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last month, nearly hundreds of soldiers from India and the United States participated in the twelfth edition of a joint military exercise near India\u2019s border with China.India has also participated in military cooperation exercises with China in recent years.IBT notes:Previously, India and China also conducted exercise in 2015 at the Kunming Military Academy in Yunnan, China\u2026 In 2013, both the countries had agreed to establish a hotline between border commanders\u2026 The hotline between the commanders is supposed to reduce the risk of friction at the border.Moreover, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui met in New Delhi on Oct. 3.India has urged the United Nations to \u201cisolate\u201d its regional rival Pakistan if it continues to refuse to join the global fight against terrorism, noting that it was long past time to identify Pakistan as a nation that sponsors and exports terrorism.U.S. and Afghan officials have long accused Pakistan of providing sanctuary to terrorists who carry out attacks in Afghanistan.In August, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Pakistan to join other countries in fighting terrorism.Last month, two top U.S. Republican lawmakers introduced legislation for the United States to officially list its current ally Pakistan as a state-sponsor of terrorism along with Syria, Iran, and Sudan.National Security, China, India, Kashmir, Pakistan, united statesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The victim was encouraged to call back and arrange emergency payments to \u201csettle\u201d the IRS case. Some targets were bilked out of thousands of dollars.The Associated Press quotes Mumbai police saying the scam \u201cbrought in more than $150,000 a day,\u201d which would make the operation worth almost $55 million per year. The Wall Street Journal says the ersatz call centers were making thousands of calls per day.\u201cSome victims were also told to buy gift vouchers from various companies, and hand over the voucher ID numbers which the impostors then used to make purchases,\u201d the police added.Up to 600 people could ultimately face charges including \u201cextortion, impersonation and violations of India\u2019s information technology laws\u201d for their role in the operation, which was big enough to fill several stories of an office building in Mumbai. Hundreds of hard drives, high-end servers, and other electronics have been seized.The gang had accomplices in the United States, who provided personal information on the victims, and took a 30 percent cut of the loot.\u201cU.S. authorities have struggled to combat an epidemic of swindlers targeting taxpayers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, an IRS watchdog, said it has received more than 1.7 million complaints in the last three years from people reporting phone calls from swindlers impersonating IRS agents. More than 8,800 victims have paid more than $47 million as a result of these scams,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reports.The New York Times states that an inside informant helped to bring the Mumbai operation down\u00a0after it had been up and running for about a year. Owners and operators of the scam were reportedly \u201cstunned to see the police\u201d because \u201cthey never thought that police would raid them.\u201dThe NYT describes how the operation used cell phone text message to frighten Americans into handing over their money:The call center employees would send mass text messages announcing an urgent inquiry to as many as 10,000 American cellphone numbers, said Parag Manere, deputy commissioner of police in Thane, in the western state of Maharashtra.If recipients called back, the call center employees would introduce themselves as \u201cChristopher or Daniel\u201d and speak with an American accent, impersonating I.R.S. officers.They would then warn the victims that the local police or I.R.S. agents would raid their homes within 30 minutes unless they sent an immediate payment, said Makarand Ranade, another Thane police official.Another phone scam reported to the IRS involved threatening voice messages. It\u2019s not clear from the New York Times account if the gang sending the text messages was also behind these robocalls, although the report does mention that seven distinct call centers associated with the crime ring were operating out of the same building.IRS, National Security, Taxes, India, Internal Revenue Service, irs, Mumbai, phone scamComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The officials did not identify the missing troops or their rank.Local and federal authorities, particularly the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have been involved in efforts to locate the missing Afghans after they are reported missing.\u201cEven though the troops were in the United States for military training, they were not necessarily always on a military base,\u201d reports Reuters.\u201cIf students under the military program are absent from training for more than 24 hours, they are considered to be \u2018absent without leave\u2019 (AWOL) and the Department of Homeland Security is notified,\u201d it adds.The Pentagon spokesman explained that \u201cAfghans in the U.S. training program are vetted to ensure they have not participated in human rights abuses and are not affiliated with militant groups before being allowed into the United States.\u201dTaliban jihadists and other terrorists have\u00a0occasionally infiltrated the Afghan army. Some of the infiltrators have carried out attacks on Afghan and U.S. forces.However, such insider attacks, officially known green on blue attacks, \u201chave become less frequent due to tougher security measures,\u201d notes Reuters.The news outlet adds:Although the number of disappearances is relatively small \u2014 some 2,200 Afghan troops have received military training in the United States since 2007 \u2014 the incidents raise questions about security and screening procedures for the programs.They are also potentially embarrassing for U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which has spent billions of dollars training Afghan troops as Washington seeks to extricate itself from the costly, 15-year-old war. The disclosure could fuel criticism by supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has accused the Obama administration of failing to properly vet immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and has pledged a much tougher stance if he wins.Since the Afghanistan war started in October 2001, the U.S. has invested nearly $70 billion on training and developing the ANDSF.Nevertheless, the Afghan troops continue to face capability gaps. The Taliban currently controls more territory than at any time since it was dethroned in 2001.Tens of thousands of Afghans have been admitted into the U.S. legally in the wake of the ongoing 15-year-old war in their country.More than 31,000 Afghans have resettled in the United States as refugees, asylees, or special immigrant visa recipients since President Barack Obama escalated the conflict soon after taking office in 2009.According to a Breitbart News tally gleaned from federal data released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), at least four Afghans have been apprehended trying to sneak into the United States across the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201cExperts said low morale and insufficient training to fight the Taliban could explain the troops leaving, in addition to a dearth of economic opportunities in the impoverished country,\u201d reports Reuters.Big Government, National Security, Obama, absconded, Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, Afghanistan, ANDSF, AWOL, PentagonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

His five-year term will begin on January 1st, succeeding Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports Guterres was the favored candidate of the United States and Europeans but describes other members\u2019 \u201crapid coalescence around his candidacy\u201d as \u201csomething of a surprise.\u201d\u201cRussia, one of the council\u2019s five members with veto power, was considered the wild card in the selection process after earlier indicating it preferred the U.N.\u2019s top job go to an Eastern European for the first time. There was also considerable pressure for naming the first woman to the post,\u201d the newspaper notes.After serving as Prime Minister of Portugal for seven years, the 67-year-old Guterres spent 10 years as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0describes the UN\u2019s failure to deal effectively with conflicts such as Syria and Yemen as stains on the organization\u2019s credibility, which Guterres can hopefully address.\u201cWith Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Security Council has chosen an outspoken and effective advocate for refugees with the potential to strike a radically new tone on human rights at a time of great challenges,\u201d said Louis Charbonneau, UN director for Human Rights Watch.\u201cUltimately, the next U.N. secretary-general will be judged on his ability to stand up to the very powers that just selected him, whether on Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, the refugee crisis, climate change or any other problem that comes his way,\u201d Charbonneau added.The BBC quotes Guterres saying he will \u201cserve the victims of conflicts, of terrorism, rights violations, poverty and injustices of this world.\u201d\u201cI have two words to describe what I\u2019m feeling now \u2013 gratitude and humility,\u201d he said from Lisbon. \u201cHumility about the huge challenges ahead of us, the terrible complexity of the modern world. But it is also humility that is required to serve the most vulnerable, victims of conflicts, of terrorism, rights violations, poverty and injustices of this world.\u201dIsraeli officials told the\u00a0Jerusalem Post\u00a0they expected Guterres to be a \u201cfriend of Israel,\u201d citing his long relationship with former Prime Ministers Ehud Barack and Shimon Peres.\u201cHe was friendly and was definitely not part of the extreme Left in Europe.\u00a0I don\u2019t remember any anti-Israel comments by him. I think he will be more fair and less aggressive in the UN than his predecessors,\u201d said former Trade Minister Micha Harish.\u201cI am delighted by the outcome of the Council\u2019s selection process. He will need the firm support of the Security Council as well as the wider membership of the United Nations to help him fulfill his mandate in these challenging times,\u201d said a previous Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who now chairs The Elders, described by the BBC as \u201can independent group of global leaders.\u201dFormer UN Ambassador John Bolton was less complimentary of Guterres during a Thursday morning appearance on Breitbart News Daily:He is a former socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, a great believer in the European Union. And I recall in our first conversation, as he was heading the High Commissioner Office for Refugees, he told me how much he was worried about \u201cpopulism\u201d in the Western world \u2013 which he defined as \u201cpeople who wanted control of their own borders.\u201d And so we had, as they say, a polite exchange of views on that subject.Kofi Annan figured in Bolton\u2019s critique of Guterres:I think it\u2019s possible he will be very different from Ban Ki-moon, the outgoing secretary-general, who we did elect in 2006 for the first time, precisely because we didn\u2019t think he would try to be a \u201csecular Pope,\u201d as Kofi Annan, his predecessor, had been described. I think Guterres \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out \u2013 but I think he may be more in the model of Kofi Annan than Ban Ki-moon, which would be a problem.AFP describes Guterres as \u201can engineer by training and fervent Catholic\u201d who has been a \u201ctireless refugee champion.\u201d He is anti-abortion, having permitted a referendum to change Portugal\u2019s strict abortion law in 1998 but received neither credit nor blame for its failure.\u201cWhen people say they cannot receive Syrian refugees because they are Muslims, those that say it are supporting [sic] terrorist organisations and allowing them to be much more effective in recruiting people,\u201d AFP quotes him saying in December.Guterres was indeed a member of the Socialist party in Portugal, in fact, its Secretary-General in the nineties. AFP notes one of his \u201cflagship measures\u201d was establishing a guaranteed minimum income. The Socialists suffered at the polls when the economy began to decline, and Portugal is now viewed as a prospect for Europe\u2019s next great economic disaster.National Security, Antonio Guterres, John Bolton, Kofi Annan, Portugal, refugee crisis, socialist, u.n. security council, United NationsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Reuters also quotes historian Asle Sveen as calling the prize \u201cout of the question\u201d for the Colombian head of state and the head of one of the world\u2019s most profitable drug trafficking operations. Sveen predicted the organizers of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), more popularly known as the Iran nuclear deal, would now be the frontrunners.Had they won the prize, Santos and \u201cTimochenko\u201d would have made away with a $936,000 prize.For two years in a row at the United Nations General Assembly, Santos declared that the ongoing \u201cwar\u201d with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was over, thanks to years of negotiations with the terrorist group\u2019s leadership in Havana, Cuba. FARC leaders escaped to Cuba during the tenure of president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who allied with the American CIA to use counterterrorism techniques implemented against al-Qaeda to decimate the group. Uribe, now a Senator and the leader of the campaign against the peace deal, has insisted that a narco-terrorist insurgency within a law-abiding country is \u201cnot a war,\u201d and that this description provides legitimacy to the FARC group as a political movement, not merely a sprawling organized crime syndicate.Cuba, no longer on the State Department\u2019s State Sponsors of Terrorism list as part of\u00a0President Barack Obama\u2019s concessions\u00a0to dictator Ra\u00fal Castro, welcomed FARC terror leaders as heroes when Uribe\u2019s campaign against them in the 2000s forced them to flee.Santos did the same the Monday\u00a0before the October 2 vote in which Colombians rejected impunity for the terrorist group. Timochenko was allowed to return to Colombia without being arrested for a meeting of the FARC in the nation\u2019s dense forest interior, from which he emerged to sign the peace deal with Santos.As per the 1991 Colombian constitution, such a deal cannot go through without a simple majority popular vote. Santos failed to achieve this, with \u201cno\u201d winning with slightly less than 1 percent of the vote.Both Timochenko\u2019s hometown and the birthplace of the FARC voted \u201cno,\u201d and the national vote map indicates the areas hardest hit by the group\u2019s half-century-long terror spree were most reluctant to reintegrate them into society. While polls asking Colombians whether they supported peace found that most were inclined to do so, leading many to believe the \u201cyes\u201d vote would pull through, other polls that asked Colombians about the specific provisions of the negotiation in question found strong resistance to said provisions.The deal would have\u00a0granted the FARC representation in Congress without having been elected\u00a0and allowed FARC terrorists to run for office beginning in 2018. It also established a special tribunal for FARC terrorists, comprised partially of FARC members, who would judge each terrorist as they handed over their weapons. The tribunal would find each guilty of either \u201cpolitical crimes\u201d or \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d \u2014 categories that were never specifically defined \u2014 and those found guilty of \u201cpolitical crimes\u201d would not have to serve a prison sentence.The Nobel Prize Committee must now sort through hundreds of candidates for a new winner. The list includes individuals and groups as varied as the Greek islanders forced to endure waves of thousands of migrants from Syria and beyond; criminal hacker Edward Snowden; and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump.\u201c2016 may finally be Edward Snowden\u2019s year\u2026 His leaks are now having a positive effect,\u201d\u00a0Harpviken speculated.National Security, Colombia, FARC, Juan Manuel Santos, Latin America, Nobel Peace PrizeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The number of refugees arriving in the United States doubled between 2014 and 2015, after\u00a0President Obama announced the normalization process.The Coast Guard also reported an increase in the number of self-harm incidents by refugees when discovered at sea, including refugees \u201cdrinking bleach\u201d upon seeing the Coast Guard, indicating an increased desperation among Cubans fleeing the island, preferring to harm themselves rather than return to the island.Cubans the Coast Guard has rescued have repeatedly expressed panic at the possibility that President Obama\u2019s friendly policy towards the Cuban dictatorship will result in worse treatment for refugees in the United States. \u201cDespite the fact that\u00a0immigration laws and policies remain unchanged \u2026 many Cubans report the\u00a0belief that they need to migrate to the United States before such immigration\u00a0policies change,\u201d a Coast Guard official told Breitbart News in January. The Castro regime has repeatedly called for the United States to cease treating Cubans fleeing communism as refugees.Medicine, National Security, Science, barack obama, communism, Cuba, Honduras, Hurricane Matthews, Latin America, raul castroComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

A survey taken between June 24-27, shortly before his inauguration, found that 84 percent of respondents had \u201cmuch trust\u201d in Duterte; 5 percent said they had \u201clittle trust\u201d in the political leader.Many suspected Duterte would temper his infamous demeanor upon assuming the presidency. As mayor of Davao City, Duterte earned a reputation for freely using profanity in public and giving police extensive freedom to seek out suspects in drug crimes, including drug addicts. As a candidate, he continued to make inappropriate remarks in public, including jokingly lamenting that he was unable to have sex with a gang rape victim before the crime occurred, and that he should have been allowed to because, he said, \u201cI am the mayor.\u201dDuterte threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States and Australia after diplomats from both countries condemned the joke. His diplomatic tenor as president has, if anything, become less subdued;\u00a0he has referred to President Barack Obama as a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and said of the European Union\u2019s opposition to his zero-tolerance approach to drug crime, \u201cFuck you.\u201dThe SWS survey was conducted before Duterte\u2019s most recent outburst, in which he favorably compared himself to Adolf Hitler and promised he would \u201chappily slaughter\u201d three million drug addicts. He has since apologized to the global Jewish community and visited a synagogue, where he told President Obama to \u201cgo to hell.\u201dThe\u00a0Chicago Tribune notes that Duterte has, nonetheless, completed\u00a0several logistical accomplishments as president: 731,000 people have turned themselves into police, suspected of drug crimes, and most who are found to suffer addiction but not participate in the drug trade will be sent to government-sponsored rehabilitation programs. He has significantly simplified government bureaucracy, as well. \u201cHe\u2019s asked local governments to cut the time for new business registrations to two days from several weeks and automate some transactions. As of late September, more than 70 percent of 1,389 local governments surveyed were in compliance, according to Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez.\u201dNational Security, Asia, barack obama, Drug War, Perfecto Yasay, Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, RussiaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He is also the director of the Yasser Arafat Foundation, established after his uncle\u2019s death in 2004.Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, and representatives from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have all spoken to Abbas, urging him to name a successor\u00a0in the event of his resignation or if he is deemed unable to continue in office.All four nations assured Abbas that his children will\u00a0be protected when he leaves his position.Former Fatah strongman Mohammad Dahlan, once considered the favored\u00a0candidate to take over the PA, is not likely to be selected, the report said. Dahlan was ousted from Fatah in 2011 following allegations of corruption and murder, and now lives in the United Arab Emirates.In recent months Abbas and Dahlan had been engaged in reconciliation talks in an attempt to prevent Hamas from gaining power ahead of elections in the West Bank and Gaza.However, last week Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Dahlan allegedly told an Egyptian official that Abbas was a \u201ccamel\u201d for regurgitating old ideas.Abbas is approaching his twelfth year as president even though his term ended in 2009. There have not been elections since 2005.On Tuesday, the Palestinian Authority announced that it was suspending municipal elections until further notice. A day earlier, the PA\u2019s High Court said elections would only go ahead in the West Bank and not the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, prompting the Palestinian Central Elections Commission to call on Abbas to delay the elections for at least six months, or until Gaza could be included.The last municipal elections between the two parties occurred in 2006 with Hamas winning, leading to a melee in the Strip bordering on civil war.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Arafat's nephew, Egypt, Egypt-Gaza border, Gaza, Gaza Strip, Hamas, High Court, Jordan, Mahmoud Abbas, Pa., Palestinian Authority, ramallah, Syria, Terrorist Organization, uaeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have expressed support for humanitarian safe zones in northern Syria that would require kinetic action to protect them from Assad or Russian forces. According to the president\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, such a policy would require tens of thousands of U.S. ground troops but would greatly ease the burden of refugees on Europe.Ahead of meetings of the Principal Committee and the National Security Council in which current U.S. policy regarding Syria will be reassessed, Russia this week deployed more sophisticated anti-aircraft and anti-missile batteries in Syria.According to a spokesperson for the State Department, all options are on the table now that Washington has suspended lines of communication with Moscow over the Syrian conflict.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Aleppo, assad regime, Humanitarian, ISIS, Islamic State, Moscow, Obama, Officials, Putin, Security Council, State Department, Syria, UN, White HouseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In the post-1967 world, after the Six Day War, Israel has controlled the entire city, and the final boundary line remains to be determined by negotiation. That\u2019s the official line, or at least it has been.But no one has argued ever before, as far as I know, that Western Jerusalem \u2013 where the Parliament, the Knesset of Israel is, where most of the government offices are, and by the way where we could build an American embassy if we wanted to \u2013 West Jerusalem is not for negotiation. The Palestinian Authority, the PLO, no one has ever claimed that the territory held in West Jerusalem by Israel since 1949 was going to go back to the Palestinians. The issue is about East Jerusalem, and where the line will be drawn.So, unambiguously, part of Jerusalem is in Israel today. There\u2019s no question about it. And that\u2019s where the President spoke. So this is just a thumb in the eye to Bibi Netanyahu. Obama\u2019s got three more months to insult Netanyahu and to demean the state of Israel.

At least 200 wounded civilians needed medical evacuation to save their lives.The veteran diplomat addressed his plea directly to the former Nusra fighters: \u201cAnd if you did decide to leave, in dignity with your weapons, to Idlib or anywhere you wanted to go, I personally am ready, physically ready, to accompany you.\u201dAddressing himself to the Russians and the Syrian government, he asked: \u201cAre you really ready to continue this type of level of fighting using that type of weapons, and de facto destroy the whole city of eastern Aleppo \u2026 which is home to 275,000 people for the sake of eliminating 1,000 al Nusra fighters?\u201dThe alternative was an immediate halt in the bombing in response to the Nusra fighters\u2019 departure, which would leave the local administration in place.The U.N. should then be allowed to reach the population with humanitarian medical aid.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, al Nusra fighters, Islamist militants, Middle East diplomacy, Staffan de Mistura, Syria civil war, Syrian government, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, United NationsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Islamic State jihadists reportedly insisted that the\u00a0fatwa was not a violation of Islamic law despite their previous reverence for the animals.Arutz Sheva highlights the Islamic belief that cats \u201care considered to be pure and even blessed animals in Islam\u201d:The law is rather incongruous since cats are considered to be pure and even blessed animals in Islam. One such Islamic tradition is the story of Mohammed\u2019s cat Mueza. Mohammed apparently cut off the sleeve of his prayer garment so that it would not disturb her sleep and reportedly blessed cats and gave them the ability to land on their feet when jumping.The treatment of cats in Islam stands in stark contrast to that of dogs, which are considered \u201cimpure\u201d/haram and banned as pets in some Muslim countries. In Malaysia, for example, a teen girl found herself the object of Islamic outrage and targeted for legal action by a fundamental Islamic organization when an animal rescue group used a photo of her smiling and petting a dog to promote animal adoption.The Islamic State has been using cats as propaganda tools as early as 2014, when they were still the \u201cIslamic State of Iraq and al-Sham\u201d and had not yet declared the establishment of a \u201cCaliphate\u201d in Syria and Iraq. At the time, the jihadis popularized a Twitter account with the handle @ISILCats, modeled after the American website \u201cI Can Haz Cheezburger,\u201d in which cats were depicted with cute, misspelled captions, intended to be read as dialogue spoken by the cat in the photo.The cats on the Islamic State account appeared often in the hands of jihadists, often also holding weapons and with captions like \u201cI Luvs My Mujahid.\u201dTwitter eventually suspended the Islamic State cat account. More than a year later, however, a prominent Islamic State propagandist once again began posting cat photos, this time posing cats next to weapons and having their captions read as threats from the cats themselves to commit acts of terror. A man known as \u201cOmar Hussein,\u201d who made a name for himself as a youth recruiter for the Islamic State,\u00a0posted photos of cats next to automatic weapons, grenades, and other jihadist material. One photo of a cat he identified as Lucy was captioned \u201cCome closer and I\u2019ll blow the entire house down!\u201dThe Islamic State has previously used Western popular culture to attract jihadis, including failed attempts at recruiting soccer star Lionel Messi and former One Direction member Zayn Malik to the cause of global jihad. These recruitment efforts have attracted a number of European Muslims unused to the austere conditions in Syria and Iraq, many of whom have attempted to defect for reasons such as \u201cI can\u2019t charge my iPod.\u201dJihad, National Security, Cats, Fatwa, Iraq, Islamic State, jihad, Mosul, radical islamComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

This is the kind of immoral garbage President Obama and his administration are allowing to be put in place in our country. $8.4 million a year\u2014with all the things our military needs\u2014can you believe that? Things like this need to be stopped. It just shows you how morally warped our politicians have become.As USA Today reports, beginning in October, the federal government will be funding \u201cgender reassignment treatments\u201d and surgeries for soldiers who claim to be transgender. The cost is expected to be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually.A recent RAND Corp. study for the Pentagon finds between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender troops in the active-duty force of 1.3 million.According to the study, between 30 and 140 hormone treatments and between 25 and 130 sex-change surgeries would be provided per year to active service members. Other healthcare costs could be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million.A policy statement released by Defense Secretary Ash Carter in June states: \u201c[T]ransgender individuals shall be allowed to serve in the military,\u201d and that \u201copen service by transgender Service members\u2026 is consistent with military readiness and with strength through diversity.\u201dAdditionally, the Defense Department says a service member\u2019s medical condition or treatment \u201crelated to their gender identity\u201d will be treated. Beginning October 3, Tricare will cover hormone treatments and therapy for service personnel with gender dysphoria. Sex-change surgeries will be performed at a military hospital or, if unavailable, at a private hospital.Like Graham, Ron Crews, executive director of Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty, said the government\u2019s use of taxpayer funds for transgender treatments is inefficient since service members having treatments or surgeries will be unable to be deployed for long periods of time.\u201cI think this is a gross misuse of military medical dollars that should be used to make our military forces deployable or to help those who are wounded or injured while they are deployed,\u201d he said, adding that the military is now also spending funds on \u201ctremendous amounts of training\u201d on transgender education.Big Government, National Security, Social Justice, Department of Defense, forced gender ideology, Rev.

Xenakis6 Oct 20160This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nRussian S-300 air defense missile system (AP)Russia announced in April that it had met its objectives in Syria, and its military was withdrawing. Then, as the army of the regime of Syria\u2019s president Bashar al-Assad began collapsing again, Russia changed its mind. Russia\u2019s increasing military buildup in Syria indicates that it has no intention of withdrawing, and may even be treating Syria as a part or a protectorate of the Russian federation.Russia\u2019s military on Tuesday announced that a battery of the S-300 air defense missile systems had been sent to Syria. This follows installation of a long-range S-400 missile defense system, and an array of other surface-to-air missiles. These have raised concerns among analysts, to which Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry responded: \u201cI remind you that the S-300 is a purely defensive system and poses no threat to anyone. It\u2019s not clear why the placement of S-300 in Syria has caused such a stir among our western colleagues.\u201dNo jihadist group has an air force, so the deployment of advanced air defense missile systems must be directed at someone else. There are several possibilities:Military Times and AFPRelated ArticlesMany analysts are concerned that Russia\u2019s military buildup in Syria means that Russia and the United States are headed for a military conflict when the next American administration takes office in January. I  wrote about these concerns several days ago.However, long-time readers know that Generational Dynamics predicts that Russia, Iran and India will be allies of the West in the approaching Clash of Civilizations world war against China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Muslim countries.Europe\u2019s last three generational crisis war all involved an invasion of Russia, but they were crisis wars for Europe, but non-crisis wars for Russia:These were brutal wars for Russia, but a component of the war was that invading armies were defeated by the brutal Russian winter.Russia\u2019s generational crisis wars were not fought with Europe. They were either internal rebellions, or they were fought with Turks and Mongols. Of particular importance were the Tatars, a tribe of Mongols that, under the leadership of Genghis Kahn, probably the greatest conqueror in the history of the world, they had defeated China in 1215, and then turned westward and conquered much of southern Russia by 1227. The Tatars in the Crimean Peninsula had intermingled with the central Asian Turks, and spoke a Turkic language. By the 1400s, they adopted Islam as their religion. It was in 1571 that the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, then ruled by Ivan the Terrible.Russia under Catherine the Great fought a generational crisis war with the Ottoman Empire from 1762-83. Russia fought the Ottomans again under Tsar Nicholas I in the Crimean War in 1853-55. World War I was a generational crisis war for both Russia and Turkey, and it saw the destruction of both Tsarist Russia (Bolshevik Revolution) and Ottoman Turkey.So Russia\u2019s great historical generational crisis wars have been not with the West, but with the Ottoman Turks, the Mongols, and the Crimean Tatars. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be in the next war as well.Related ArticlesKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Russia, Syria, Bashar al-Assad, S-300, S-400, Clash of Civilizations, Turkey, China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, War of the Spanish Succession, Sweden, Great Northern War, Napoleonic Wars, France, World War II, Germany, Crimea, Tatars, Mongols, Turks, Genghis Khan, Catherine the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Ottoman Empire, World War I, Bolshevik Revolution\n Permanent web link to this article\n Receive daily World View columns by e-mailNational Security, barack obama, Bashar al-Assad, Russia, SyriaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The meeting was held to prepare for an attack on the positions of the security forces in Hamrin Mountains, al-Zawiya area and Ajil area in Salahuddin Province.Daily Mail notes that the incident is not unprecedented:It is not the first time this year that they have managed to accidentally take out their own troops, with around a dozen extremists being killed in eastern Afghanistan in March when they accidentally set off a bomb that they were trying to plant.At least 21 other jihadists were also injured during the botched operation in Afghanistan.ISIS often uses young people as suicide bombers.In August, video footage emerged purporting to show Kurdish security troops removing an explosive belt from an alleged ISIS suicide bomber, believed to be 12 or 13, moments before it was to be detonated in Kirkuk.Earlier this year, the West Point-based Combating Terrorism Center reported that ISIS is \u201cmobilizing children and youth at an increasing and unprecedented rate [and] that the number of child and youth militants far exceeds current estimates.\u201dReferring to the jihadist group\u2019s use of child suicide bombers, the report determined:It seems plausible that, as military pressure against the Islamic State has increased in recent months, such operations [\u2026] are becoming more tactically attractive.Of 89 cases of young people who were featured in official ISIS reports as \u201cmartyrs\u201d between January 2015 and January 2016, the report found that \u201c39 percent died upon detonating a vehicle-borne explosive device, 33 percent were killed as foot soldiers in unspecified battlefield operations, six percent died while working as propagandists, and four percent committed suicide in mass casualty attacks against the civilian populace,\u201d points out Breitbart Jerusalem.Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Daesh, Iraq, IS, ISIL, ISIS, Islamic State, Kirkuk, Suicide Bombers, suicide vestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But there\u2019s little prospect President Obama will ultimately approve them.\u201cThere\u2019s an increased mood in support of kinetic actions against the [Assad] regime,\u201d an anonymous senior administration official told WaPo. \u201cThe CIA and the Joint Staff have said that the fall of Aleppo would undermine America\u2019s counterterrorism goals in Syria.\u201dEarly on in the Syrian civil war, President Barack Obama called for regime change and threatened airstrikes against the Assad regime after accusing the Syrian dictator of using chemical weapons in 2013.However, so far Obama has only authorized strikes against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda-linked groups in Syria.The Obama administration has provided military assistance to some anti-Assad rebels\u00a0but has largely favored diplomacy over armed intervention as a means of dethroning the Syrian leader.Meanwhile, Russia has remained Assad\u2019s most important ally, placing Washington and the Kremlin on opposite sides of the conflict.The various ceasefires negotiated by the U.S. have all failed. The Obama administration attempted to bring peace to Syria with the help of Russia, but that effort fell apart this week.Following the unraveling of the Syria peace efforts, Kerry accused Russia of \u201cfavoring war over diplomacy amid widening rifts with Washington,\u201d notes The Post.\u201cPeople that are serious about pursuing peace behave differently from the way Russia has chosen how to behave,\u201d declared the secretary.The suspension of negotiations \u201cdoes not come lightly,\u201d he added, denouncing Russia\u2019s alliance with Assad as \u201cirresponsible and profoundly ill-advised.\u201dAccording to the U.S. State Department, negotiations aimed at ensuring the safety of pilots from Russia and the United States will carry on.Kerry was a strong supporter of Obama\u2019s initial plan to launch airstrikes against Assad after the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons.\u201cHe has complained privately that White House resistance to more intervention has hurt efforts to persuade Russia, in particular, to take a tougher tone with Assad,\u201d reported the Associated Press (AP) in June.That month, a \u201cdissent channel cable\u201d signed by nearly 50 mid-level U.S. State Department officials who deal with U.S. policy in Syria advocated military action against Assad, including \u201ctargeted airstrikes.\u201dWaPo now reports that the Obama administration is once again considering bombing Assad, noting that the president will likely remain opposed to such a move.The Post notes:Last Wednesday, at a Deputies Committee meeting at the White House, officials from the State Department, the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed limited military strikes against the regime as a means of forcing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to pay a cost for his violations of the cease-fire, disrupt his ability to continue committing war crimes against civilians in Aleppo, and raise the pressure on the regime to come back to the negotiating table in a serious way.The options under consideration, which remain classified, include bombing Syrian air force runways using cruise missiles and other long-range weapons fired from coalition planes and ships, an administration official who is part of the discussions told me. One proposed way to get around the White House\u2019s long-standing objection to striking the Assad regime without a U.N. Security Council resolution would be to carry out the strikes covertly and without public acknowledgment, the official said.Big Government, Middle East, National Security, Iran, Obama, Russia, Syria, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. State DepartmentComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The inflammatory remarks on both sides only fuel the tensions and could result in a further deterioration of the human rights situation.We reiterate our call for unfettered and unconditional access to both Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir to enable us to independently and impartially monitor the human rights situation. We stand ready to support efforts to de-escalate the situation.Pakistan, India, and China all have competing claims to Kashmir, but Beijing, which maintains a relationship with the two other countries, has remained in the shadows during recent territorial disputes.Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after India accused Pakistan of backing militants who carried out an attack in Indian-held Kashmir on Sept. 18 that killed at least 18 Indian soldiers.In retaliation, India launched \u201csurgical strikes\u201d against four camps in Pakistan-held Kashmir, allegedly killing 38 terrorists.Pakistan maintains there were no strikes. It claims that Indian troops used small arms and mortars to explicitly target Pakistani military personnel, killing two soldiers and wounding nine others.The killing of\u00a0Burhan Wani, commander of the Kashmir-based terrorist group Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, by Indian troops in July has also fueled the strained relationship between India and Pakistan.Both countries accuse one another of provocations in Kashmir. India says Pakistan has been arming and training militants in Indian-held Kashmir fighting for independence from India or in favor of a merger with Pakistan, a charge that Islamabad denies.Pakistan has also been linked to terrorist groups operating in Kashmir, namely Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.Meanwhile, Pakistan has accused India of cracking down on dissent in India-held Kashmir.The Hindu reports:Pakistan has been trying to ensure U.N. involvement in the situation. Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif had raised the issue of \u201chuman rights violations by India\u201d in Jammu and Kashmir in the General Assembly, but no other country has mentioned it.After India\u2019s military action in across the LoC, Pakistan\u2019s Permanent Representative to the U.N.

As the nation is governed by strict Sharia law, fathers have significantly more control over their children than mothers.\u00a0\u201cThe terminology of \u2018parental abduction\u2019 does not exist in Iranian laws; nevertheless, hampering custody orders by one of the parents or a third party has civil and criminal aspects punishable by punitive damages and imprisonment,\u201d the Library of Congress notes, adding, \u201cA parent cannot and should not be deprived of his/her custody or visitation rights, unless due to a legal necessity, and by a court order.\u201d Spousal abuse complaints from a wife are rarely taken as a \u201clegal necessity\u201d that would require the child to be taken away from a father.RCN notes that Meneses\u00a0fears being treated as an Iranian citizen by the government there because of the ill treatment women receive in that court system.\u00a0Carolina Zambrano, a cousin of Meneses\u2019s, told the outlet, \u201cthe consequences she may face from the moment she stood up to her husband, because of their religious traditions, are that she could lose her life.\u201dColombia is a particularly attractive hub for Middle Eastern immigrants in Latin America. It boasts a robust Lebanese and Syrian population and its cities are home to a healthy Iranian population. Iran appears to have seen an opportunity for expanding its influence in the region, sending Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif on a Latin American tour in August.While the Iranian government has overtly courted business in the region, the terrorist outfit Hezbollah, which Iran supports financially, has cemented its ties with many drug trafficking and terrorist operations in the region, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Iranian \u201ccultural centers\u201d have also served to promote both Iranian political interests and Shiite Islam throughout Latin America, largely depending on the warm diplomatic ties with the socialist dictatorship in neighboring Venezuela.The outreach appears to have worked: the Muslim population of Latin America and the Caribbean grew nearly 25 percent between 2010 and 2016.Iran is a prolific employer of the death penalty, particularly against women who violate Sharia law. The NGO Safe World for Women lists the crimes punishable by death\u00a0for women in Iran: adultery, lesbianism, murder, and \u201cmoharebeh,\u201d a vague law that\u2019s meaning can be translated as anything from \u201cheresy\u201d to \u201cworking to undermine the Islamic system\u201d or \u201ccooperating with foreign agents.\u201d It is possible that Meneses\u2019s husband may employ this last charge given Meneses\u2019s use of the Colombian legal system and media to attempt to escape spousal abuse.Iran has exacerbated its use of the death penalty in recent years. Amnesty International described the use of capital punishment as \u201cextensive\u201d between 2015 and 2016, noting that the government provides for such inhuman execution methods as stoning and relies on \u201cvague charges\u201d and unfair trials to determine whom to execute. A particularly egregious execution season occurred during the first half of 2015, when nearly 700 people were killed.National Security, Social Justice, capital punishment, Colombia, feminism, Iran, Latin America, Spousal AbuseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street8 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Luckey created Oculus Rift from a small dollar Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and then sold it two years later to Facebook for $2 billion. Since the acquisition, Luckey has become the celebrity \u201cface of virtual reality in gaming\u201d tens of thousands of first mover enthusiasts.Despite being a billionaire, Luckey\u2019s standard garb has been sandals, shorts and Hawaiian shirts at national conferences. He also lives in a shared house with several others top-ranked multiplayer videogamers.But as Breitbart News reported in late September, Luckey was outed as the anonymous billionaire behind a $10,000 donation to \u2018Nimble America\u2019, a pro-Donald Trump group that the Left claims are alt-right and white supremacy advocates. Nimble has been very active at posting negative stories about the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton online \u2013 a practice the Left calls \u201cshit-posting.\u201dA number of VR developers, including Scruta Games and Tomorrow Today Labs, have claimed they will not give their support to the roll-out of Oculus Touch as long as Luckey remains at the company. \u00a0But the loss of Luckey would also cause huge dissention from his legions of avid social media followers.Despite having to follow Google\u2019s highly-touted $79 \u201cDaydream VR\u201d fabric encrusted stand-alone peripheral for their new Pixel phone line that premiered two days earlier, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seamlessly slipped into Luckey\u2019s role to host 2,000 attendees in San Jose for the Oculus Connect 3 developer conference that began on October 6.Zuckerberg quickly crushed all the back-biting and the political friction regarding Luckey by announcing that Facebook intends to add another $250 million to the $250 million the company has already invested in developing virtual reality (VR) applications.Zuckerberg commented, \u201cWe should [all] build software and experiences that follow the way our minds work and the way we process the world.\u201d He then astounded developers by unveiling a new prototype wireless version of its\u00a0Oculus\u00a0Rift headset.The Bluetooth enabled device is Oculus\u2019 third VR and by far the most powerful device. The prototype uses a headset camera for its software to determine the position of the user within a millimeter, a technique Oculus calls \u201cinside-out tracking\u201d. Current Oculus systems rely on a much less precise system of cameras and sensors in the same room.Eric Florenzano, Oculus VR senior software engineer recruited from Twitter, commented that \u201cinside-out tracking\u201d has the potential to be an entirely new product category. He highlighted, \u201cIf the device can track your position in a room, you could leave the room where the device is and even walk outside. It starts to blur the line between virtual and augmented reality.\u201dZuckerberg demonstrated a couple of very engaging applications. AltSpace VR will allow up to eight Oculus VR users to enter in a virtual world as liquid-metal avatars. The participants can hang-out and chat, or engage in realistic play, like fencing.By adding an Oculus\u2019s Touch handset, Zuckerberg was able to mimic using a selfie stick to take a virtual reality picture of himself and his wife Priscilla Chan, then seamlessly post to Facebook with a single hand swipe.Despite Oculus only having about 1 million Oculus VR users worldwide, compared to Facebook\u2019s 1.1 billion users, Zuckerberg emphasized that virtual reality will eventually dominate social media.As a sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment to move ahead with the attendees that came to Oculus Connect 3, Zuckerberg announced that Oculus was launching a $10 million development fund at the conference to drive a rapid expansion into educational content.Breitbart California, Education, Tech, facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, Oculus Connect 3, Oculus Touch, Oculus VR, palmer luckeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

They are instead scrambling to stop Cassie Jaye, a filmmaker whose documentary on the men\u2019s rights movement called The Red Pill\u00a0was premiered tonight in New York.Today, feminists are getting ulcers not from their horrific diets, but from a self-identified feminist who has serious bona fides both as a filmmaker and a friend to lefty causes like marriage equality. This is the type of woman who liberals typically would fall over themselves to praise with compliments like brave and stunning.But they won\u2019t be so complimentary this time, because Jaye\u00a0has made a film on a topic feminism doesn\u2019t want the public to hear about, and she has done it fairly, which means feminism can\u2019t afford for anyone, most especially women, to see it.The Red Pill sets out to explore the men\u2019s rights movement through interviews with MRA leaders like Paul Elam, feminists that oppose the movement, video footage of events and graphics and animations highlighting particular issues. Although many were skeptical of Jaye\u2019s\u00a0ability to fairly represent men\u2019s rights activists, she has, I think, succeeded.Jaye\u2019s\u00a0budget ended up directly on screen. Her style keeps things visually interesting when they could otherwise turn boring quickly. I was impressed by the graphics she uses, which become especially devastating as the hate-facts on topics such as military deaths start rolling.The graphics in this documentary are some of the most visually appealing\u00a0anti-feminist images I\u2019ve ever seen, outside of my own YouTube channel of course and that of the Factual Feminist, Christina Hoff Sommers.This is a film that made me feel a variety of emotions, and that is no mean feat when the viewer\u2019s heart is as cold and black as mine. You can expect to find humor at various points, become angry at feminists assaulting police officers and pulling fire alarms and disgust at the holier-than-thou pronouncements from academics and activists.One of my staff members, a father of two, reported tearing up at one interviewee\u2019s description of the struggles he went through in family court and the toll the process had on both his health and his son\u2019s health. The story is anecdotal, but anecdotes humanize the subject in a way statistics never can.This is not a movie short on statistics by the way, they are discussed in detail and shown on the screen throughout.The other emotion I experienced was horror at numerous short scenes of Jaye\u00a0driving around. I had to peek through my fingers expecting a crash at any moment. I freely recognize this is a personal hangup, not everyone shares my well-known fear of femsteering.Jaye\u2019s\u00a0interview style is to focus on the thoughts of her subject, and then to comment on what they\u2019ve said afterwards in voiceover. I found it to be effective, but there were times with both feminists and MRAs where I wished she was more confrontational during the interview.Another device she\u00a0uses effectively is to insert her own video journals into the documentary in order to chronicle her reactions to what she has learned. I found these interesting and felt\u00a0that Jaye\u00a0was sincerely sharing her opinions and emotions. The Red Pill includes some snippets of her acting at the beginning, and with all due respect I don\u2019t think she has the chops to fake these journals.The video journals add a secondary plot to The Red Pill: the red-pilling of Cassie Jaye herself. Unfortunately these journals seem to disappear in the latter part of the movie and this thread is not as fully realised\u00a0as it could be.The Red Pill includes interviews with a variety of activists on both sides of the men\u2019s rights debate. Some of the interviewees are impressive both in their appearance and in their material. Others are a bit harder to watch.My chief complaint about The Red Pill is that almost all of the men\u2019s rights activists interviewed are older men. The casual viewer might come away thinking that MRAs are all middle-aged. Why is there almost no representation of younger men, who face their own unique challenges?I\u2019d love to have seen Jaye\u00a0interview a man kicked out of a school by a kangaroo court because a female student regretted a consensual sexual encounter. As readers of my work will know, I\u2019ve chronicled the increasing problems faced by younger men in pieces like the Sexodus.The film includes an interview with the infamous \u201cBig Red,\u201d an angry Canadian feminist notable primarily for looking like the love child of a bad Canadian Michael Jackson impersonator and Elmo from Sesame Street. I would have thought it a good opportunity to counterpoint her with a young MRA.But my gripes are minor. The Red Pill is a powerful film on a complicated, important, yet woefully unaddressed issue. I applaud Jaye for having the intestinal fortitude to not only tackle this subject, but to do so fairly. After all, it would have been much easier to produce a documentary on how wonderful feminism is and how stunningly brave Emma Watson is for fighting the horrors of being called bossy as a child.I\u2019m not going to give away any more of The Red Pill because you need to watch it yourself. I will point out my favorite part, which is Karen Straughan blowing feminism out of the room by illustrating the horrors of Boko Haram before \u201cBring back our girls\u201d became a liberal clarion call.I found it delightful that Karen was interviewed in a noisy bar: talk about a perfect setting. I can tell you this \u2014 everyone concerned about men\u2019s rights should thank God that Karen Straughan is on your\u00a0side.There is another theme teased out\u00a0by\u00a0The Red Pill, which is that feminists will always, always try to shut down those who\u00a0disagree with them. Two interviewees describe this explicitly: Erin Pizzey, who opened shelters for both men and women, is not welcome at the very shelters she founded, because her views are not politically correct.Warren Farrell describes a similar experience: as his interests changed from women\u2019s rights to men\u2019s rights, his speaking engagements and other projects simply dried up.Jaye is herself an example of this phenomenon.\u00a0The picture was almost not made\u00a0due to lack of funding. It was only after I covered Jaye here at Breitbart\u00a0that it was funded well above its target. I am pleased to report that Milo fans, Mike Cernovich and the wider men\u2019s rights movement did not fund the\u00a0project in vain.The Red Pill does not yet have a digital distribution deal, but you can keep an eye on the\u00a0website for ways to see the film. While you wait, enjoy the wave of feminist harpies attempting to tear it apart. There is already a review from The Village Voice which apologizes for \u2018taking the bait\u2019 by reviewing The Red Pill.Who are they fooling? They wake up every morning with the sole aim of being offended.My message to Cassie Jaye is a simple one: buckle up and prepare for every slimy outlet in the mainstream media (which is most of them) to come after you. You\u2019ve done the unthinkable. You\u2019ve made a fair-minded documentary about feminism\u2019s most hated target.As always, hatred from the\u00a0mainstream media is the best advertising one\u00a0could hope for, especially with the group that could gain the most from The Red Pill, young men and women who distrust the media and are witnessing the fall-out of radical feminism on America\u2019s campuses on a daily basis.Madeleine Albright infamously said, \u201cThere is a special place in hell for women that don\u2019t help women\u201d, and if that\u2019s true, The Red Pill has earned Cassie Jaye her own spot there. On the bright side, she will have women like Karen Straughan to hang out with. And me, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m looking forward to our infernally fabulous brunch dates.Follow\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero)\u00a0on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

Tickets are still available for purchase via IndieGoGo.The Daily Beast\u00a0took an in-depth look inside Wintrich\u2019s operation in the run-up to the event, as well as the controversy raging around it.Lucian Wintrich is pacing the floor of his East Village walkup, chain-smoking cigarettes and drinking white wine. It is 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, and a little more than 48 hours until Wintrich\u2019s performance art show, #DaddyWillSaveUs, which Wintrich is billing as the first pro-Trump art show in the nation\u2019s history, is set to open.\u201cArt show,\u201d however, is perhaps not the right phrase. #DaddyWillSaveUs was more of a chance for liberals\u2019, or, for that matter, mainstream Americans\u2019 most hated villains to come together to see if they could offend people further. The show is a museum piece of precisely the kind of degraded public culture that Trump had unleashed, dropping its pants before anyone who dares believe civil norms can still be saved.Besides infamous tech bro Shkreli, who has apparently taken up sculpture in his spare time (and who seems to be under the impression that Wintrich will actually assemble the installation, hence the \u201cfucking around\u201d), Wintrich said the show is slated to feature Internet provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos bathing in a tub of pig\u2019s blood (to showcase Islamic anti-gay violence)The article goes on to describe Wintrich\u2019s attempts to secure a venue for the event, from the tumultuous cancellation of his first option,\u00a0to problems securing the second.It was because of Yiannopoulos that one of their back-up places fell through. The space didn\u2019t have two exits, which Yiannopoulos\u2019s security team said is necessary since his performances so often attract death threats. Other back-ups were falling through too. The Columbia University College Republicans offered to help find a space, but it would have required everyone to be pre-registered. A place in Long Island City looked promising; but Wintrich and Akbar wanted the commotion, or at least to plant a flag in the heart of the gallery district of Brooklyn. Another feared that as soon as word got out about the show, the owner of the building, \u201ca flaming liberal,\u201d would demand its cancellation. They thought of reaching out to Trump, but didn\u2019t know how to get hold of him. They called New York Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, who brushed them, and the American Civil Liberties Union, which said they couldn\u2019t much help them either.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those conservatives who see a conspiracy everywhere,\u201d said Wintrich. \u201cBut there is a real conspiracy here.\u201dHe pointed to an email that the culture writer Jamie Peck sent to some hundreds of her writer friends suggesting that they collectively ignore \u201cDaddy Will Save Us.\u201d Someone on the list sent it to Wintrich, who promptly sent it toBreitbart, fanning the flames even further. Proceeds from the show\u2014tickets cost between $65 and $125\u2014were meant to go to a charity that helped gay veterans. But another liberal media outlet shamed the non-profit from participating, and they said they wouldn\u2019t accept the money. \u201cOh now look at this,\u201d Wintrich said holding up his laptop. \u201cJames Michael Nichols of the\u00a0Huffington Post is calling me a homo-nationalist.\u201dHe doubled over with laughter.This was of course the point too. The bigger the protest, the more publicity they would get, and the whole point of the whole thing, about who is entitled to free expression and who isn\u2019t, would be confirmed. The culture wars would have at last flipped sides. Whereas before it was conservatives from the Catholic League protesting Andres Serrano\u2019s \u201cPiss Christ,\u201d now it would be liberals protesting drag queens lying in vats of pig\u2019s blood, never mind that they would be protesting not the art or the expression so much as the unapologetically racist and provocative performances.Read the full piece at\u00a0The Daily Beast.Milo, Tech, Donald Trump, Lucian WintrichComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He appeared at a closed hearing in federal court in Baltimore on Aug. 29 and has been in government custody since, according to court records.During a court-ordered search of Martin\u2019s home, the FBI \u201cseized thousands of pages of documents and dozens of computers or other digital storage devices and media,\u201d prosecutor Zachary Myers said in a court filing made public Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe digital media contained many terabytes of information that must be reviewed by appropriate authorities.\u201d\u201cWhen Booz Allen learned of the arrest of one of its employees by the FBI, we immediately reached out to the authorities to offer our total cooperation in their investigation, and we fired the employee,\u201d the company wasted no time in declaring. \u201cWe continue to cooperate fully with the government on its investigation into this serious matter. There have been no material changes to our client engagements as a result of this matter. Booz Allen is a 102-year-old company, and the alleged conduct does not reflect our core values.\u201dThe\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0quotes U.S. officials who said Martin was \u201choarding\u201d classified materials \u201cgoing back as far as a decade in his house and car, and the recent leak of the hacking tools tipped investigators to what he was doing.\u201dAccording to these sources, some of the documents found at his home \u201ccould be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.\u201dThe \u201chacking tools\u201d referenced in the\u00a0Post\u00a0story are the cyber-weapons put up for auction by a group calling itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d in August. These wares were purportedly the best hacks from the NSA\u2019s Equation Group, and a number of observers at the time said they looked like the real deal. NBC News reports some of the hacking code in Martin\u2019s possession was the same as the material offered by the Shadow Brokers.It would appear investigators were able to track Martin down as the source of this leak very quickly. (Or, as the Politico report suggests, the timeline of Martin\u2019s arrest might make it difficult to connect him to the Shadow Brokers.)The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0calls Martin\u2019s arrest \u201canother humiliating lapse for both Booz Allen and the NSA,\u201d following Snowden absconding with a vast trove of sensitive documents. The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0cites officials attempting to defend the administration by pointing out many of the documents taken by Martin were evidently taken before the Snowden story broke, and new security measures were put in place.Politico suggests the delay in publicly announcing Martin\u2019s arrest and initial court appearance could mean he is cooperating with the government. He has voluntarily waived his right to be indicted or released within 30 days, giving prosecutors until March 1st to prepare an indictment.Prosecutors appear to be working on a plea-bargain deal, telling the court that trying Martin would be difficult because defense lawyers would not have the security clearances necessary to review the evidence. The sensitive nature of the evidence is also why it is so difficult for the public to be told the extent of the damage he might have caused to national security.\u201cAt this point, these are mere allegations. There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country.\u00a0What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served our nation honorably in the United States Navy, and he has devoted his entire career to serving and protecting America,\u201d said the defense lawyers in question, Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman.However, FBI agents noted Martin falsely denied taking the sensitive documents found in his home and car, then later admitted he knew taking them was wrong.NBC News noticed Snowden weighing in on the Martin arrest:This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products? https://t.co/otgOwB5efm\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 5, 2016In other words, he thinks Martin might have been the source for media reports that the NSA knew about critical security flaws in various software products, but kept its knowledge secret \u2014 putting consumers, businesses, and other government entities at risk \u2014 because the NSA wanted to exploit those flaws for its own intelligence-gathering purposes.Interestingly, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0notes that among the \u201cmany terabytes of information\u201d found in Martin\u2019s possession were documents produced in 2014, which is when some major stories accusing the NSA of knowing about critical commercial security flaws were published, concurrent with the public\u2019s discovery of the Heartbleed bug.Big Government, National Security, Tech, Edward Snowden, FBI, hackers, justice department, NSA, Shadow BrokersComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I can\u2019t believe that in 2016 leftists are still appropriating bomb culture from the Religion of Peace. I\u2019m so offended!You\u2019re in for a special treat this evening, because I am going to speak to you about my most popular topic, feminism.First, some celebratory news. It\u2019s a bad day for feminists: first, hand-wringer in chief Hillary Clinton just had another 2,050 emails dropped. Not the mysterious tranche we\u2019re waiting for from her server, \u00a0but those of her campaign manager John Podesta.The emails reveal that Clinton\u2019s campaign deliberately portrayed Bernie Sanders supporters as misogynistic \u201cBerniebros\u201d and Sanders himself as a sexist with \u201cextreme views\u201d on women.Another victory I just heard about before coming on stage: the University of Alabama was just forced to climb down after demanding that the College Republicans over there pay $8,000 to have me speak. It\u2019s a new way colleges are trying to shut down speakers they don\u2019t like.Well, guys. The only person at risk at a Milo talk is me. And I bring my own security. And it\u2019s illegal for you to charge students these exorbitant fees. The university has now confirmed that its students will be charged a grand total of zero to have me attend.Anyway. To this evening\u2019s main event \u2013 feminism.\u00a0I get a lot of emails on this subject. Their message is simple.The message is \u201cThank you.\u201d Thank you for standing up for me, and for boys who have no voice. \u00a0Thank you for reminding me that my life has a purpose, and is what I make of it, not what feminists tell me.Thank you for speaking up against power. \u00a0Because feminism is the power now, in many ways. \u00a0Hillary Clinton is running for president on the back of racism against whites and sexism against men, touting the mythical gender gap we all know so well.Nowhere is this power greater than on American campuses. The good news is we see widening cracks in that power, with every rape hoax that is exposed, and with every alumnus that withdraws his funding after another asinine stunt and the requisite caving of administrations to show they are good feminists too.That constant stream of letters from young men galvanized me to action, resulting in this tour and the privilege to speak directly to students.Interestingly, there is a second type of email I get, not as frequently as the first but still quite regularly. These letters are from women, also saying thank you.You can tell a woman\u2019s fan letter to me because they are typically caveated with all the hurtful things I say that they don\u2019t like\u2026 for example \u201cDear Milo you are completely wrong on trannies they are girls if they want to be\u2026.. But I must write to say thank you for standing up to feminist idiots.\u201dIt used to surprise me that women would write to me for speaking out on behalf of men, but it helped me realize there are women just as much against third-wave feminism as I am.One of my most popular catchphrases is \u201cFeminism is Cancer\u201d. \u00a0No matter how you look at it, Feminism is Cancer. Some of you might call me radiation therapy. \u00a0But the analogy is bad. \u00a0Radiation therapy damages normal tissue in a desperate attempt to kill cancer.But my humor, facts, and charming personality are harmless to normal people. \u00a0Only feminists, their Muslim buddies and black lives matter suffer from post traumatic stress disorder when I speak.Rich people that get cancer will seek out the experts at the Mayo Clinic. You\u2019ve all been referred to the experts on feminism, the MILO clinic. I know you thought it would treat STDs but you\u2019re wrong!The good news is that everyone in this room and everyone watching online are also the chemotherapy that America needs.Radical feminism of course started in academia. Some would assume it is a type of brain cancer. \u00a0But I\u2019ve seen enough of universities to know we can conclusively say feminism is a bowel cancer.American college campuses have gone to shit.Smoking can take decades to give smokers lung cancer. \u00a0But college can give women the cancer of feminism as early as their first semester. \u00a0Why aren\u2019t there warning labels on college? \u00a0Warning: College may turn you into an extremely unloveable woman. \u00a0Warning: College may ensure cats are your only close companions. \u00a0Warning: College may quadruple your body piercings and quintuple your BMI.Speaking of smoking, have you noticed America\u2019s nanny state never controls the really unhealthy behaviors that plague our culture? \u00a0They will ban large sodas, but not put a waiting period on blue hair dye. \u00a0They check ID for alcohol purchases if you look younger than 35, but do they weigh feminists before serving them venti frappuchinos? No.Some cancer sufferers smoke medicinal marijuana to help with their appetite. \u00a0Feminists, of course, don\u2019t need any help with their appetite.What I will speak to you about tonight is WHY feminism is cancer, how it has metastasized on college campuses, and what sort of effect feminism has had on young men, who have had the dubious distinction of being the first generation to be schooled at feminist universities.But if we stopped there, we would tell only half the story. \u00a0Because as negative as radical feminism is for men, it is worse for women.Let\u2019s start with men.Men have always borne the brunt of the risk in romantic relationships. You\u2019re the ones expected to make the first move, make the judgements about whether it\u2019s a good time to approach, work out how to ask her out, and then wait with their self-esteem on the line while she makes a decision.Men have accepted this burden without complaint, because they see it as part of being a man. Somehow, I expect that feminists would see it as a great injustice if they were the ones saddled with this task. But men aren\u2019t whiners, so they put up with the double standards, and have done for years.Amazingly, yet predictably, feminists aren\u2019t satisfied that the scales are already tilted in women\u2019s favor. They want complete control over romantic relationships.It\u2019s not enough that they can destroy a man\u2019s self esteem with a word of rejection. They also want to throw men in jail if their advance is too awkward, or if they themselves say yes and later regret it.Complete control. That\u2019s the impulse behind feminist attempts to expand the definitions of sexual assault and harassment.That\u2019s the reason we now have \u201caffirmative consent,\u201d perhaps the most kafkaesque set of laws in America.Affirmative consent, for those who don\u2019t know, is the idea that if you don\u2019t consent at every stage of a sexual encounter, it\u2019s rape. That means asking for every kiss and asking for every boob squeeze. It\u2019s almost as if feminists want everyone to remain celibate.Just because they can\u2019t get any sex, they want the rest of us to have deserts down there too.Men won\u2019t even get a fair trial. If they\u2019re accused of sexual assault on a college campus, they\u2019ll be hauled before a group of college administrators for a \u201ctribunal,\u201d in which they will be denied legal representation and face a lower standard of evidence than in a criminal court. Even if they somehow beat this rigged system, like Emma Sulkowicz\u2019s victim did, they can still have their lives ruined in the media.When men are being told that they\u2019ll be labelled \u201charassers\u201d for making an awkward advance, and \u201crapists\u201d for bad drunken sex or not getting consent for the fifth make-out session, there\u2019s only one logical course of action: retreat.The rise of feminism has fatally coincided with the rise of video games, internet porn, and, sometime in the near future, sex robots. With all these options available, and the growing perils of real-world relationships, men are simply walking away.In 2015, I wrote an article on this trend, which I call the \u201csexodus.\u201d It was an astonishing success, and was read and shared millions of times. Clearly the idea resonated with a lot of men growing up in a modern, feminist society.Men who retreat aren\u2019t necessarily the biggest victims here. They can function without real-world relationships much better than women. The real catastrophe is what it\u2019s doing to society as a whole.Birth rates are collapsing. If you took away immigrant communities, who tend to have higher birth rates, many western countries would have birth rates approximating those of Japan.Of course, beyond the sexodus, feminism is also affecting birth rates by producing the pathetic, unloveable creature known as the \u201cmale feminist.\u201d You\u2019re unlikely to get laid if you\u2019re part of the sexodus, sure, but celibacy is practically guaranteed as a male feminist. These beta orbiting cucks proudly carry the feminist banner, but they look at the cause as their best hope to get laid. Why do you think so many male feminists turn out to be virgins, perverts or, even more often, both?There is another aspect of feminism that is very negative for men, but I will only briefly touch on it because most of the men in this room are young and therefore consider themselves invincible.If you get cancer as you age, the medical establishment\u2019s kowtowing to feminism will likely hurt your chances of surviving.Women\u2019s cancers like breast and ovarian cancer are widely publicized, you can\u2019t go anywhere without those pink ribbons being in your face.A Breitbart analysis of stories on NPR\u2019s website showed there are 2.8 times as many stories on women\u2019s cancers as men\u2019s.But the lack of publicity won\u2019t kill you. Men are used to toiling away in thankless jobs. It is the lack of research dollars.Breast cancer and prostate cancer affect a similar number of women and men respectively, and kill a similar number of their sufferers each year. But breast cancer receives more than double the research funding of prostate cancer, for no other reason than it affects women. And maybe because it involves tits.In other words, not only is feminism cancer \u2014 it\u2019s making other cancers worse!That is a REAL gender gap.Cancer patients receive chemo, which causes severe weight loss. Only a matter of time before it\u2019s banned as a form of fat-shaming.What do we think: compulsory chemo for all self-described third-wave feminists? Maybe that\u2019s too much to hope for. Feminists constantly beg for money, especially on social media and through kickstarter projects that never seem to be completed. \u00a0Unlike those parasites, cancer sufferers do deserve your donations. I suggest the Prostate Cancer Foundation.Now, the fact that feminism is destructive to young men isn\u2019t surprising. But what may be surprising to the average listener is the second stage of the feminist cancer: that it spreads to the very gender is claims to empower.It is easy to compare feminism\u2019s effect on women to leukemia. It often affects the young, and once it appears it quickly spreads throughout the entire bloodstream.On the other hand, whenever you see leukemia patients in commercials for charities, the kids are always so cute\u2026 Have you EVER heard of a cute feminist?Another similarity is the type of survivor left behind. When a woman is fortunate enough to beat feminism and call herself a feminism survivor, she knows she is on a road to recovery and is no longer at risk of terminal insufferability. Remission from feminism should be celebrated with loved ones just like remission from cancer.Radical feminists are perplexed and outraged when confronted with a woman that is not a feminist. With tremendous self righteousness they will hold up a dictionary and say the definition of feminism is seeking equality between the sexes.The problem for them is nobody is buying it any more. \u00a0A Vox poll in 2015 shows that only 18% of Americans consider themselves feminists. \u00a0But 85% of Americans believe in equality between the sexes.Either feminism has a serious marketing problem, or third-wave feminism has nothing to do with equality.My money is on the latter.Third-wave feminism, the only kind allowed on campus these days, replaces girl\u2019s fantasies about unicorns and fairy kingdoms with one equally as mythological: the concept of patriarchy.Feminists live in a grim, terrible world where an evil and powerful patriarchy controls a woman\u2019s every move and holds them down in low paying jobs. Feminism has created a world in which men are the enemy of women.In this dystopian world, women and girls are weak and incapable of making it on their own without the help of the sisterhood and whatever pathetic beta orbiters can be roped in to repeat their conspiracy theories and lies.In the odd, fake, world feminists live in, the patriarchy says to women \u201cyou are nothing without us,\u201d \u00a0but in the real world it is feminists saying to women \u201cYou are nothing without us.\u201dFrom my viewpoint, modern feminists WANT you to be weak, WANT you to be in unsuccessful relationships with men, and WANT you to be uneducated. \u00a0They will happily fill women\u2019s heads with drivel in a gender studies course, but that isn\u2019t an education.Gender studies graduates emerge from university dumber than when they started school, believing more untrue things and dramatically less able to function in the real world.Many feminists on this campus are no doubt scrambling to get into their safe spaces now that I\u2019m here. \u00a0We rightly mock safe spaces, because we know part of college is facing uncomfortable things, and learning to logically and rationally confront ideas you don\u2019t like.Fragile feminists think safe spaces will protect them from the world, but they don\u2019t. \u00a0In fact safe spaces grant the rest of the world a brief reprieve from dealing with left-wing stupidity, which is the only real argument for them. \u00a0But the real result of a safe space is to reinforce ignorance, fragility, and a toddler mentality. It\u2019s therapy culture.Some of you may be asking: if feminism is a low percentage of the American population, how can it hurt women?\nWell, cancer is also a low percentage of its sufferer\u2019s cells, but it still damages the entire body by spreading to vital organs. A low percentage of Americans may be feminists, but feminism has spread into the most vital sectors of American life: academia, media, and politics.And this has potentially deadly consequences.Feminism pushes for women in combat, because to feminists, women can do everything men can do, better.This is of course a lie. And when some of the jobs are really serious, like, say, defending our nation, it becomes a very dangerous lie.Beyond the physical differences in strength and coordination between men and women, there are deeper issues. A study from the Marine Corps last year found that all-male units performed better than mixed units in 69 per cent of tasks.What did the Army learn when contemplating the madness of women in combat? \u201cFemale soldiers suffered double the rate of injuries compared with male colleagues in Army combat training, including jobs in field artillery and repairing the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.\u201dWhat did the Marines discover? \u201cWithin the research at the Infantry Training Battalion, females undergoing that entry-level training were injured at more than six-times the rate of their male counterparts.\u201dWomen in the army don\u2019t want combat roles. Only 8% of female troops surveyed want a combat role.But the military still pushed forward, to avoid a feminist backlash. \u00a0And they did so by lowering standards. \u00a0Lowering standards doesn\u2019t just affect America\u2019s ability to win wars. Lowering standards in the military gets people killed, including, and disproportionately, women.If they don\u2019t get you killed on the job, Feminists will affect your career by creating an adverse relationship in the workplace between men and women.It used to be considered good advice for celebrities and athletes to keep witnesses around in case they are charged with sexual misconduct by a woman looking for a payday. Now it\u2019s sound advice for every man, including your bosses and professors.Even if you do get a good job, feminists may get you laid off so that your employer can look like a good corporate citizen. Intel invested $300 million in diversity efforts, which is another way of saying they spent $300 million on nothing. \u00a0What you may not know is shortly after that initiative, they announced $300 million in cuts across business units. Hello looking good to feminists, goodbye jobs for men and women in research and development.Almost every effort to control speech and shut down either \u201cabusive speech\u201d or \u201chate speech\u201d, terms that mean absolutely anything a person wants them to, is a feminist project.About 1 year ago, the United Nations suggested we censor the entire Internet to save feminist\u2019s feelings.They released a completely insane report called \u201cCyber Violence Against Women And Girls: A Global Wake-up Call\u201d.Now, if I was writing a report on \u201ccyberviolence,\u201d I could do it in 140 characters, but someone infinitely more gifted already has.The UN report itself contains a number of bizarre attempts to equate critical tweets on the internet with physical violence.\u201cA cyber-touch is recognised as equally as harmful as a physical touch\u201d says the report. In their press release, UN Women claim that \u201ccyber violence \u2026 places a premium on emotional bandwidth.\u201dWhatever the fuck \u201cemotional bandwidth\u201d is.The UN isn\u2019t so worried about women being raped and harassed in Europe, or discriminated against in the Middle East. If they did they wouldn\u2019t have put Saudi Arabia on their human rights committee.They care that people criticize feminists on the Internet. Think about that for a while.Beyond the UN, look at Twitter and their trust and safety council. \u00a0They basically killed Twitter by embracing the nonsense idea of \u201conline harassment.\u201d Naturally, their death became obvious once they banned their most fabulous and entertaining user.\u00a0Feminism does a terrible job picking causes\u2026.. And icons. I think they need a man\u2019s touch in this area.Think about high profile feminist heroes:Why does feminism always select this type of charlatan to be their heroes? \u00a0Why not find successful women that don\u2019t exist to enhance the appearance of perpetual victimhood? \u00a0You do the math.The sight of Hillary suppressing a seizure is nothing compared to the sight of a feminist when told that some women want to be stay at home moms.Feminists aren\u2019t for women\u2019s choice, they are for women doing exactly what they are told to do by feminists. \u00a0It is a very communist set of ideals, which is why you see a big crossover between feminism and Marxism.Hillary Clinton in her delightful speech on the Alt-Right was kind enough to read out some of my headlines.My favorite one is \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.\u201dSorry, no offense, but it\u2019s true. Women have been far unhappier over the last 35 years.This corresponds to the feminist message: where self-medication, childlessness, and slaving away in a cubicle are touted as the path to utopia.Even beyond your chosen lifestyle, feminism will affect your life.Consider marriage. \u00a0Pew Research has found a REAL gender gap, but this one is about attitudes about marriage in young people. Comparing data from 1997 and 2012, Pew finds a big split has developed. \u00a0While the percentages used to be similar, now interest among young men has dropped considerably while the interest among young women has risen considerably.This is the natural result of feminism, young men are witnessing the financial horror of divorce for men, along with the unfairness of child custody. They are seeing feminists and assuming their potential spouse might be like those awful harpies.Most women aren\u2019t, but they are suffering thanks to the negative stereotypes of women put about by feminism. \u00a0Women on the other hand are having trouble finding men interested in marriage or relationship, making them desire a suitable man more.And we know women always want what they can\u2019t have. It explains why I have so many female fans.Feminists on campus will try to fill your head with garbage. One example is their rape on campus stats, are they up to 4 out of 5 girls will be raped? \u00a0They always change the stat! It\u2019s always garbage.Feminists on campus will talk your ear off about the wage gap. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t how many economists show that the wage gap is a result of choices made. \u00a0America is the most free society for women on earth. \u00a0Women are free to study what they want, and they naturally gravitate towards majors that suit them.Some of these are high paying, like nursing and occupational therapy, both of which are more than 85% female. \u00a0\u00a0But most are not. \u00a0Elementary Education and social work have similar percentages of female students, but much lower pay.Men on the other hand dominate high paying STEM majors like Electrical Engineering. \u00a0Women are free to study engineering, and often make fine engineers.But why on earth would feminism feel the need to shoehorn women into studying a subject they don\u2019t want to? The movement that claimed to be about female empowerment now seems to be about female conformity.You\u2019re probably quite depressed by now.Don\u2019t be.Together, we are winning the war against feminism. We are publicizing their tricks on campus and off, exposing their lies, and proving that women don\u2019t need shrill harpies calling them weak victims of a made up patriarchy.I greatly admire the young people who have to fight feminism in the trenches of academia, as opposed to from a giant tour bus with their face on the side.Keep resisting, keep pointing out the facts, and keep laughing. Together, with facts and laughter, we can fight off this disease. Thank you.Published from prepared remarks.\u00a0Milo, Social Justice, Tech, Auburn University, feminismComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Both of the gangs whose members were at The Crust the night of the shooting are identified as gangs in multiple court documents available at the Williamsburg James City Courthouse.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

According to a Pew Research poll, 91% of Americans feel as if they have lost control over how their data is used and processed by companies. In a statement released on their website, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler argued that \u201cin today\u2019s digital world, consumers deserve to be able to make informed choices about their privacy\u2026 online.\u201d\u201cFCC regulations limit how your phone company can repurpose and resell what it learns about your phone activity without your consent. Similar rules don\u2019t exist for broadband service today,\u201d Wheeler continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a gap that must be closed \u2013 consumers who use the network of the 21st century deserve similar protections.\u201dUnder the proposal, ISPs must get permission from consumers before broadband providers can use or share the vast majority of their data, such as GPS locations, email content, financial information, and browser history.Such data is currently free to access, and could net ISPs a huge profit by selling it\u00a0to advertisers. Currently, Verizon is estimated to spend around $4.8 billion on purchasing Yahoo after acquiring AOL last year for $4.4 billion in order to form an advertising business.Initially proposed in March, the FCC have toned down the strength of the regulation. Originally, \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d data such as names and addresses would also need prior approval to be passed on, but after complaints from ISPs, this is no longer required. Agency officials have said that the \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d data privileges can still be revoked by the customer.This backtrack came after ISPs claimed\u00a0that such a move would leave them in an unfair position when compared to websites such as Google and Facebook. Mobile phone apps and websites would not have to abide by the proposal, as they come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, not the FCC. However, Wheeler noted that websites owned by the broadband providers would also be exempt.Overall, the plan has had positive feedback from pro-privacy pressure groups. Gaurav Laroia of Free Press said in a statement that the proposal was a good defense \u201cagainst internet service providers\u2019 unpermitted use of personal information.\u201dA planned vote on the regulations will take place on October 27th at the monthly meeting of the five FCC commissioners.

The hacking claim Friday was another setback in already strained U.S.-Russia relations.The White House declined to say whether the formal attribution would trigger sanctions against Russia. A senior Obama administration official said the U.S. would respond \u201cat a time and place of our choosing,\u201d but any retaliation may not take place in the open.The official said the public won\u2019t necessarily know what actions the U.S. has already taken or will take in the future against Russia in cyberspace. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.Federal officials are investigating cyberattacks at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Election data systems in at least two states also have been breached.\u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement with the Department of Homeland Security.The statement said recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on websites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks, and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona, are consistent with the methods and motivations of efforts directed by Russia, which has denied involvement.\u201cThese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSuch activity is not new to Moscow. The Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.\u201dA phone message and email left with the Embassy of the Russian Federation were not immediately returned Friday afternoon.California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, applauded the administration\u2019s decision to publicly name Russia as the source of the hacking.\u201cWe should now work with our European allies who have been the victim of similar and even more malicious cyber interference by Russia to develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling,\u201d Schiff said.Intelligence officials say some states have experienced scanning or probing of their election systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. They stopped short, though, in attributing this activity to the Russian government. And administration officials say it would be difficult to alter the results of the election because of the decentralized nature of the American electoral process.2016 Presidential Race, National Security, Tech, Adam Schiff, DCLeaks, department of homeland security, Guccifer 2.0, Russia, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Ard is a former Yahoo employee.The suit also singles out\u00a0former chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt, according to SiliconValley.com:\u201cWhen Savitt began at Yahoo the top managers reporting to her \u2026 including the chief editors of the verticals and magazines were less than 20 percent female. Within a year and a half those top managers were more than 80 percent female,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cSavitt has publicly expressed support for increasing the number of women in media and has intentionally hired and promoted women because of their gender, while terminating, demoting or laying off male employees because of their gender.\u201cOf the approximately 16 senior-level editorial employees hired or promoted by Savitt \u2026 in approximately an 18-month period, 14 of them, or 87 percent, were female.\u201d the lawsuit said.Mayer, a former Google engineer, became a prominent symbol of female empowerment in the tech industry when she was hired as Yahoo\u2019s CEO in 2012, especially since she was pregnant when hired. Initially, she was credited with rescuing the company from a long downward spiral under several previous chief executives. However, the company\u2019s woes continued, and Mayer has failed to find a new business model for Yahoo, which is now largely focused on spinning off its core assets.Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos has been one of Mayer\u2019s more vociferous critics, calling her \u201ca symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s disastrous tokenism.\u201dYahoo has not yet responded to the lawsuit, except to defend its policies and performance reviews as fair, the\u00a0East Bay Times reports.Joel B.

He then threatened to send any money he received from Wintrich to the Clinton campaign.Lucian Wintrich, the exhibition organizer, is a Trump supporter and creator \u00a0of \u201cTwinks For Trump,\u201d a photoseries showcasing young gay male Trump supporters. His work was featured at the \u201cGays For Trump\u201d party at this year\u2019s RNC. Wintrich\u2019s support for Trump cost him his job after he was praised in a column by Milo Yiannopoulos.Wintrich\u2019s latest pro-Trump art show is still raising funds on IndieGoGo.\u201cThis is not something that we would have shown as part of the gallery program and did not intend to support it\u201d said Amrhein.\u201cAny money that would be made by Pierogi through this exhibition will be given to the Hillary Clinton campaign, a hopefully fitting irony for this narcissist asshole.\u201dAmrhein later sent a follow-up comment stating that the event was cancelled, and publicly accusing Wintrich of \u201clying to him\u201d about the nature of the event.In text messages between Wintrich and Pierogi seen by\u00a0Breitbart,\u00a0Amrhein can be seen fretting that a pro-Trump event would cause \u201c20 years of reputation\u201d to \u201cgo down the drain\u201d even as he attempted to placate Wintrich by trying to find him a different venue.Amrhein claims to have been tricked into believing that the event was satirical, yet earlier text messages between himself and Wintrich show that he was fully aware this was a Trump-related, and anticipated the potential PR fallout.\u201cWe\u2019ll go ahead with your show but we we need to take The Boiler off the press release and advertising\u201d wrote Amrhein in a text message dated September 28th. \u201cWe also won\u2019t allow to have Trump\u2019s name appear outside the gallery on the sidewalk or street.\u201dHowever, as negative press piled up (Mic.com recently scared a gay military charity into declining funds that Wintrich planned to raise at the event), Amrhein grew more hysterical.\u201cYou lied to us. There are Alt-Right figures in the show. You lied to us!!! I don\u2019t care about the press. I guess I do care you are destroying us at our expense\u201d wrote Amrhein in a text to Wintrich this Wednesday. He then informed Wintrich that he wanted to cancel the event.The cancellation comes amid news that left-wing gay activists are planning to protest the event. Gayletter, a New York-based gay magazine, emailed a message calling for protests earlier today, and a Facebook event entitled \u201cQueer Love Against Trump\u2019s Hate\u201d calling for protests against \u201cbigotry and fascism\u201d at the event has also been set up.This is not the first art event to cause political controversy. Other famous examples include\u00a0Piss Christ,\u00a0a plastic crucifix submerged in the urine of artist Andres Serrano, which debuted in the late 1980s. That too generated protests, but left-wing supporters of the art piece defended it as an example of freedom of speech.Almost thirty years later, the tables have turned. Now it\u2019s left-wingers trying to shut down art events they find offensive, and right-wingers defending artistic freedom.You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.2016 Presidential Race, Milo, Tech, Gavin McInnes, James O'Keefe, Lucian Wintrich, Martin Shkreli, Milo YiannopolousComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Unfortunately, this has only had marginal effect in stemming the tide.The\u00a0Washington State Gambling Commission isn\u2019t satisfied. As of October 5th, 2016, they have \u201cnotified Valve Corporation that it must\u00a0immediately stop allowing the transfer of virtual weapons known as \u2018skins\u2019 for gambling\u00a0activities through the company\u2019s Steam Platform.\u201dThe commission\u2019s press release recalls information from the Esports Betting Report as an example, citing the reported $1 billion that the \u201cCSGO Lounge\u201d betting site gained between January and August 2016 alone. It\u2019s a serious problem \u2014 not the least of which is due to the fact that children are especially vulnerable to a video-game based gambling system that can be easily accessed on the internet, as opposed to a restricted brick-and-mortar location in an area where such activity is legal.The problem is that this would require Valve to entirely dismantle its Counter-Strike item marketplace, which is in and of itself harmless. It allows for players to buy, sell, and trade in-game cosmetic rewards received\u00a0from crates awarded through gameplay. Washington State is attempting to force Valve to forfeit legitimate business because of exploitation that exists outside their ability to control.It\u2019s hard to see how this could result in any sort of change \u2014 it reeks of bureaucracy with limited understanding of the platform and its activities. But unless Valve does suspend its marketplace entirely, it\u2019s just as difficult to see how this problem could be addressed in any effective manner.Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church\u00a0@Get2Church\u00a0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Tech, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, valve, video gamesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0With NASA expected to conclude its research on the International Space Station before 2024, U.S. space travel and colonization has been turned over to private companies like SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic for the conquest of Mars.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk kicked off the land rush to Mars when he formally announced on September 26 at the 67th\u00a0International Astronautical Congress\u00a0in Guadalajara, Mexico, that he intends to \u201cMake Humans a Multi-planetary Species\u201d by having SpaceX launch the first leg of its privately funded two-year mission to Mars by 2022. Musk hilariously commented at the conference, \u201cI\u2019d like to die on Mars, just not on impact.\u201dMusk outlined that SpaceX\u00a0would soon unveil a powerful reusable rocket system called the Interplanetary Transport System\u00a0(ITS), which can carry a 100-person working crew to the \u201cRed Planet\u201d to set up permanent extraterrestrial colonies, factories and mines.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, speaking at an early October conference in Chicago, said his company was joining the land rush, and that he is \u201cconvinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,\u201d according to\u00a0Bloomberg.Boeing unveiled its heavy-lift rocket project, called the Space Launch System,\u00a0which\u00a0also aims to develop reusable rocket systems. Many aspects of Boeing\u2019s plan appear similar to SpaceX, but Muilenburg commented that his plan is a more realistic approach because it will rely on at least $60 billion in private sector satellite launches and NASA-funded development prior to a human-crewed venture to Mars in the late 2030s.NASA has essentially been operating as a joint venture in space travel with the Russians since the July 17, 1975 \u201crendezvous between the Soyuz and Apollo spacecrafts proved that the Soviet Union and the United States could set aside their differences in the name of advancing manned spaceflight,\u201d according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.The partnership allowed Washington to\u00a0curtail drastically its very expansive NASA budgets, which at the height of the Apollo program accounted for 4.2 percent of all federal budget spending. Today, that budget is less than one-half percent of federal spending.As NASA\u2019s budget declined, the U.S. space agency also struck partnership deals with other nations and the private sector to help finance research efforts. Although the U.S. continued to pay most of the cost of the International Space Station, the U.S. gained benefits, sharing the expenses with others.Historically, manned space flight has been mostly about basic research, and had few military applications. A few experiments could only be conducted in zero atmosphere, but there is no advantage to putting military special forces in space. Remote satellites are far superior to manned spacecraft for reconnaissance and imaging programs.But with the U.S. once again becoming a military and policy adversary on the world stage to the Russians and the Chinese, the importance of space as the ultimate high ground in terrestrial warfare is becoming more obvious, according to Stratfor.The U.S. has always banned Chinese scientists from working with their NASA counterparts because of national security concerns. The International Space Station required all participating nations to hand over technical information and make their hardware freely accessible to anyone involved in the program, a step China has refused to take.China, with the help of Russia, launched its second space lab into orbit in September as a preparatory step to a permanent space station in the 2020s. Russia has recently announced that it intends to separate their portion of the International Space Station modules in 2024, and then build their own outpost, or partner with the Chinese.China and Russia are focused on colonization and economic exploitation of the moon. Beijing plans to follow the model of its One Belt, One Road\u00a0strategy of using economic projects and partnerships to gain political support abroad, particularly in the developing world. Moscow\u2019s space strategy is focused on military projects and the projection of power.But NASA and the Obama administration are squarely focused on reaching the Red Planet, and will let private sector companies grab Mars as the ultimate resource platform.Big Government, Breitbart California, Tech, Apollo, boeing, China, Interplanetary Transport System, ITS, Multi-planetary Species, Russia, Soyuz, Space Launch System, SpaceX, stratforComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

So, before we dig down into RimWorld itself, are there any indie projects that you feel like are doing some of these things as well? Is this something that you think indie games are starting to do more of, or do you think RimWorld is still sort of an outlier?\u00a0This sort of targeted emotional design, games that are made to tell stories?Tynan: Well, I think games that are made to tell stories is actually sort of the wrong way to say it, right? I\u2019m sorry, I hate to push back, but people say this and to me that\u2019s like \u2014Nate: No, no, please, do correct me. What\u2019s it about?Tynan: You know, a game is made to generate an experience together with the player, and to say it\u2019s there to \u201ctell stories,\u201d well, write a book or make a movie if you want to write a story.Nate:\u00a0Perhaps that was poorly worded, then. I was talking about the stories that are being told in concert\u00a0with the player. For instance, RimWorld generates almost limitless \u201cstories.\u201d Every time I play the game,\u00a0I have something interesting to tell people. It transforms from an experience to a story so seamlessly. Do you think anyone else is doing this, or moving in that direction?Tynan: Certainly. There are people who are definitely trying things, who are definitely out of the \u201ctriumph,\u201d or \u201clooting\u201d\u00a0AAA assumptions, where everything has to be a\u00a0World of Warcraft loot-fest, or a Call of Duty triumph-fest. I mentioned Abzu, which I think is a very in-your-face, \u201cWe are going to do this sort of dreamy non-competitive emotion.\u201dI think they\u2019re great experiments and they\u2019re worth playing. I think they push it a little far, they\u2019re a little bit narrow in that sense, to be really mainstream, but they certainly have a place in the ecosystem of games. I think that\u2019s great for an indie game to do. I would say, that there\u2019s still mostly like the classic mixtures of exploring and fighting and gaining triumph, and absorbing stories that have been placed there for you with\u00a0different variations. So, there\u2019s definitely people doing experiments out there; but I think there\u2019s still a ton of open ground or unexplored territory.Nate:\u00a0That\u2019s what my poorly worded question was trying to get at. [laughs]Tynan: Yeah, man. I mean, there\u2019s so many designs for games. I have design notes written down for various games that I would love to try making, if I had time. But probably most of them wouldn\u2019t work, because last time I had six designs, and only one of them actually worked in the end.But, yeah, I mean you\u2019re going to be seeing totally new genres, totally new styles, new things that work that you never would have thought of, for decades into the future at least. And that\u2019s not even taking into account changes in hardware, interfaces with all this VR fanciness coming up. So yeah, definitely, there\u2019s a lot of new territory to explore.Nate: You have a very optimistic outlook on games as a whole. There\u2019s always chatter about video games being \u201cdead,\u201d having tapped out the experience. I understand that people are growing bored with, as\u00a0you\u2019ve said, these \u201ctriumph-centric\u201d experiences that have one or two emotions to offer. But I notice that you seem to have a lot of confidence that that\u2019s not going to be the case in\u00a0the long term.Tynan: Well, especially from my point of view. If other people are just trying to do the same thing over and over, it\u2019s great for me, because it lets me do all the new stuff.Nate: [laughs] Touch\u00e9.Tynan: I\u2019d love to see other people\u2019s interpretation of these, of trying to come up with new designs. But no, I don\u2019t agree at all with that sort of talk. I think that maybe the business will grow slower, or at least as fast as it has. In terms of the experiences are that are possible, I think that there\u2019s a huge amount of open territory to explore. I have a bunch of ideas I want to explore, \u2014 and probably most of them wouldn\u2019t work \u2014 but maybe one would, and I hope it would be original. I think it would.Nate: Do you think something like virtual reality is instrumental to those possible experiences? Or is it just another way to interface with the same essential\u00a0ideas?Tynan: I think VR would definitely open up new avenues, but it\u2019s not absolutely essential. We could do without it. It\u2019ll open up new avenues, I mean, what else can I say? That\u2019s pretty much it. It\u2019s not going to be like \u201cOh my god, everything\u2019s going to be VR.\u201d No, not everything\u2019s going to be VR for a while. Maybe in the future, when we\u2019re plugging people\u2019s brains in like The Matrix, that could kind of displace the other styles of experience. But for anything foreseeable, it\u2019ll just add on a new facet.Nate:\u00a0What I\u2019ve seen a lot are people initially being intrigued, and then almost immediately disappointed by VR\u00a0offerings. I think what\u2019s happening right now is VR is emerging, but it\u2019s basically just being used as a tool to do the exact same things that everybody else is already doing. It hasn\u2019t evolved beyond \u201cgimmick,\u201d yet. Does that make sense?Tynan: The thing with VR is that it\u2019s essentially a technology whose big strength is that it builds immersion, a sense of \u201cbeing there.\u201d But that\u2019s something that has been really obvious, and sort of in your face, and it\u2019s a buzzword that\u2019s been around forever. It\u2019s been pushed very hard.So I would say that, in terms of \u2014 if you want to think about the avenues of game design, and the ones that are pretty well plumbed out, and the beaten paths, that is already one of them. So that is something that is going to, I guess maybe soften the impact of VR. Because people have been trying to make game that are so immersive, and so graphically intense, and \u201cit\u2019s just like you\u2019re there,\u201d for so long, and they\u2019re having such great success with these fantastic genre first-person video games, that VR \u2014 in terms of what it adds \u2014 seems incremental in that respect.For me, when I think of unexplored or interesting avenues of game design, it\u2019s not in anything that has anything to do with trying to make you feel like you\u2019re someone looking around in a room or doing something, right? For me, it\u2019s all about abstraction. Abstract system interactions. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s sort of off the beaten path, because it\u2019s kind of hard to pitch that. Like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to look at sort of a different variation of spreadsheets and numbers and try to extract some experience from it, and look at icons and move around and do stuff.\u201d But, I think that\u2019s such an underrated mode of interaction because people underestimate the power of human imagination.So, if you think about abstraction, you think about novels, you read a book, right? Some people are like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to play a video game where you just have to look at little symbols all the time, and like read stuff all the time,\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s like, have you ever read a book? \u2026Sometimes the answer\u2019s no. I mean not everybody reads books.Nate: [laughs]Tynan: [laughs] They\u2019re not for everybody. But the power of the media is undeniable, right? Because it\u2019s just squiggles on a page, but if you read a good Stephen King book, or Alastair Reynolds or whatever, the stuff that\u2019s in your brain is going to be just as powerful, or more so, than anything you\u2019re going to see in a movie.So, you take the same principle and apply it to video games; maybe it\u2019s not just about trying to make you feel more and more and more like you are someone else in this specific place in this continuous time situation doing a thing continuously. Because there\u2019s so many interesting systems and stories that just can\u2019t be expressed that way.Nate: Right.Tynan: And you look at a lot of successful indie games. You know there\u2019s \u2014 ones you wouldn\u2019t even think of, like Football Manager is obviously really compelling to people. Factorio, which is really a fantastic indie game about building this factory out of these little parts that move, like conveyor belts and little arms that move things and other things that mine things and things that combine other things. And it sounds stupid because its certainly not immersive, but it\u2019s incredibly compelling.Then there\u2019s RimWorld, where I\u2019ve targeted just the imaginative story aspect of it, where you essentially put these little chess piece humans in the game, and they\u2019re each just a little 2D graphic and they slide around and bump into each other and they eat little food and they do the work that you tell them to do. And sometimes they freak out, and they each have a little label that says, \u201cOh, this person is a psychopath, this person is kind, this person is abrasive,\u201d or something like that.We put these little labels on it, and let them interact and the story that comes out of it is \u2014 once the player absorbs it and sort of imagines all of these interactions happening, it just blossoms into this story inside the player\u2019s mind. And that\u2019s completely at odds with the mode of interaction that is what you would call \u201cimmersive,\u201d or anything to do with VR.I think that\u2019s the direction that\u2019s currently unexplored, is in abstract systems. And AAA will almost never do it. I mean, there\u2019s Paradox, who are a publisher that makes these sort of hardcore strategy games, and they\u2019re a pretty big company, and they have pretty darn consistent commercial success with their games, and I think it\u2019s because they\u2019re willing to do that, while everybody else is like, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re Lara Croft. Okay you\u2019re a soldier in the future. Okay, you\u2019re a soldier in WWI. Okay, you\u2019re a soldier in Medieval Times,\u201d right?We\u2019re always putting people in someone else\u2019s shoes and trying to make you feel like you\u2019re someone else, but that\u2019s, to me, that\u2019s just one narrow pathway. So, that\u2019s my opinion of VR; it\u2019s going to do that thing we\u2019re doing well even better, but it\u2019s not going to have anything to do with any of this other stuff that I find fascinating and that I think is really unexplored.Nate: I thought with something like the meteoric success of The Sims, we\u2019d see a lot more in the vein of complex character interaction and simulation.Tynan: Yeah, The Sims is like a surreal game for me. For some reason there are these certain classic games that just don\u2019t get cloned. Like, you know how a game comes out, and it\u2019s really successful and then other developers just start making copies or ripoffs or whatever, right? Flappy Bird \u2014Nate: [coughs] Call of Duty. [coughs]Tynan: Yeah, like whatever right? This happens for so many genres.Like real time strategy games where a couple of them came out in the nineties, and they were successful, and now it\u2019s a genre. So it\u2019s fine; they\u2019re not ripoffs, they\u2019re not just clones of each other. It started a genre. But for some games, it just doesn\u2019t happen. Like The Sims. Nobody made \u2014 what other games are in the genre of The Sims? There\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s like literally nothing there.Nate: Perhaps RimWorld, to some extent?Tynan: There\u2019s some indie games. RimWorld is definitely in that vein.Nate: It\u2019s more closely related to it than others? I don\u2019t know.Tynan: Yeah, but RimWorld\u2018s still like a much more challenging strategy game struggle and survival, and it\u2019s really quite different.Nate:\u00a0True.Tynan: So, there\u2019s something about this certain type of game that makes people just not want to follow it. Like, I would have imagined that a couple companies would have tried to copy The Sims, but no one does.\u00a0To me that\u2019s just something that\u2019s funny about the game design sphere, and The Sims points to a whole area that still needs to be explored. Everyone\u2019s all, \u201cWell, how can we change the first-person shooter to make it cooler?\u201d How much effort are we putting in to saying, \u201cHow can we rethink The Sims to do it more differently and cool?\u201d You know? I think that should be done.\u00a0\u00a0Part 3 of my interview with Tynan Sylvester will cover RimWorld itself; its past, present, and nebulous future.

In the piece, Adams says that he didn\u2019t notice that he had been shadowbanned until many of his followers reported being unable to see his tweets on their timeline. Adams noted that the shadowban seemed to coincide directly with him requesting that his followers send him videos of Hillary Clinton supporters attacking Donald Trump supporters. Why did I get shadowbanned? Beats me. But it was probably because I asked people to tweet me examples of Clinton supporters being violent against peaceful Trump supporters in public. I got a lot of them. It was chilling.\u00a0Adams says that earlier in the week he had been bombarded with comments and notifications from \u201cClinton trolls,\u201d as he calls them. He believed that this was a coordinated attack on his Twitter account as he has openly defended Trump on multiple occasions. \u00a0Adams attributes this sudden influx of Clinton supporters to an article written about him on Slate. Adams also notes that the only speaking event he had scheduled for 2017 was cancelled as the organisers felt they had to \u201cgo in a different direction.\u201d Adams suggests\u00a0this was also a result of the negative light he has been painted in by the media following his support of Donald Trump. Adams does seem unphased by the negative reactions, however, finishing his blog piece by saying:All things considered, I had a great week. I didn\u2019t realize I was having enough impact to get on the Clinton enemies list. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to be happy about any of this, but that\u2019s not how I\u2019m wired.

But unless Steam specifically curates and monitors every single title granted Early Access release, it\u2019s hard to see how else it could possibly go.The Early Access model may be Steam\u2019s most robust exclusive market. It\u2019s hosted everything from promising freshman efforts like Unturned from brand new developers, to indie mega-hits like ARK: Survival Evolved\u00a0and\u00a0Divinity: Original Sin. Part of its success is the leeway granted to creators of all stripes, allowing unique ideas to flourish that would never have made it to the shelves of any retailer.The other side of that coin is an inherent risk. Whether it\u2019s the blatant exploitation of games like The War Z (AKA\u00a0Infestation: Survivor Stories), the quiet abandonment of Towns, or Double Fine\u2019s sudden cancellation of further development on\u00a0Spacebase DF-9, it\u2019s a market uniquely prone to risks.\u00a0Games might appear on Early Access as barely-playable shells, or virtually complete experiences in need of the wider testing audience that few independent developers can afford to hire outright. Anything can happen, and usually does.Valve absolves themselves of responsibility for this unpredictability with a very simple approach: What you see is what you get. It\u2019s explained at the top of every Early Access title, stated plainly in the Early Access FAQ, and probably read about as often as an Apple TOS. In essence, it says that you should only pay for what\u2019s available at the time of purchase, and not base your decision on \u201cpotential\u201d content down the road in development.And there are more wrinkles. Multiplayer-centric Games like H1Z1, Rust,\u00a0or DayZ often reach peak popularity before they\u2019re anywhere near complete. If you want to join in while the servers are still populated, you have to buy in whenever it\u2019s hot. This leads to \u201cfad\u201d game projects that die off as soon a developers realize that people have moved on. Rarely do the few hundreds remaining loyalists see a completed product. Even if they do, it\u2019s usually long after the release is relevant to the market.While it\u2019s easy to say that Steam should just make sure abuses don\u2019t happen, it\u2019s an almost impossible to quantify how exactly that could be done. Aside from cautioning users not to purchase an unfinished product with an uncertain future, how do you police individual developers as to where the line is between failure and abuse?347 games are currently in Early Access, at all conceivable stages of development. Almost certainly, some of them will be great. Some already are. But there\u2019s the rub: putting down hard-earned cash on \u201calmost\u201d is always going to be a gamble. Valve is\u00a0very much aware of that, and you should be, too.Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church\u00a0@Get2Church\u00a0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Tech, Steam, Steam Early Access, Valve Corporation, video gamesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I love you too.\u201dShe tells him: \u201cAw, I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re saying, but I love you so much.\u201dTheir exchanges took on extra significance in Saudi Arabia, where unrelated men and women seldom see one another. Almost all public spaces are gender segregated and most women cover their face, hair and bodies in billowing black cloth.While the conversations appear harmless, Saudi media outlets say the teen was detained late last month for \u201cunethical behavior\u201d due to the videos. Footage posted online on Sept. 25 purports to show his arrest, and Abu Sin\u2019s YouNow site, on which he used to post almost daily, had not been updated for 13 days.In Saudi Arabia, where the internet has become the preferred forum for young Saudis to meet and express themselves, his arrest sparked mixed reactions.Abu Sin\u2019s videos could constitute a violation of the country\u2019s cybercrime law, which prohibits producing material that harms public order, morals or religious values, according to lawyer Abdulrahman al-Lahem. He may also be found in contempt of the kingdom\u2019s sometimes unyielding interpretation of Islamic law. Al-Lahem was quoted in the Saudi newspaper, Okaz, as saying the teenager could consequently face between one and three years in prison.In comments to the Saudi Gazette daily, Riyadh Police spokesman Col. Fawaz Al-Mayman said Crockett and Abu Sin made \u201centicing videos\u201d that \u201cbecame famous and received negative attention.\u201d He said police had received requests from the Saudi public demanding Abu Sin be punished. After his arrest, the case was forwarded to the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution, al-Mayman said.The Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for further details on the case. Abu Sin\u2019s real name has not been made public. Al-Mayman said he is 19 years old.The Saudi daily Arab News wrote that people in the kingdom argue the teenager deserves to be tried because his videos \u201cmade people laugh (at us).\u201d In an op-ed for the pan-Arab Asharq al-Awsat newspaper, prominent Saudi commentator Mishari al-Thaidy said the incident raised serious questions about how young people in the kingdom are being raised.Yet in an editorial published Sunday, Arab News wrote that if Abu Sin was indeed arrested based on the demands of public opinion, then \u201clet it be known that this published opinion believes Abu Sin should be released \u2026 and given his own television show!\u201d\u201cWhen did being \u2018silly\u2019 ever become a crime?\u201d the editorial continued.Crockett released a video saying she doesn\u2019t really understand the situation in Saudi Arabia, but that many people are blaming her as the reason for his arrest.\u201cObviously, I think this whole situation is totally crazy and unfair, but I don\u2019t feel I should be getting any hate for this because I have no control over it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that it went viral. It\u2019s not my fault that he got this fame from it or that I got it.

The protest shown in the photos was partially in response to the September 16 police shooting of Terrence McCutcher that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It included\u00a0\u201ca walk down Sheridan Road where protestors sat for a moment of silence with fists raised\u201d and the \u201cdie-in\u201d protest, which took place in Loyola\u2019s student center.A member of the protest group claimed that the movement was motivated specifically out of a desire from students \u201cto have a place to talk about the violence that\u2019s been ongoing these past couple years, but more specifically the past two weeks, with the shootings in Missouri and the one in South Carolina.\u201dOne student prepared a sign that read, \u201cBlue Klux Klan.\u201d Another student referenced Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s plan to hire more officers by comparing Chicago cops to pigs: \u201cAmeriKKKa is not welcome #blackoutchi #1000pigs #leavemethefuckalone.\u201dAlthough the university doesn\u2019t have an official position on the Black Lives Matter movement, the endorsement of the Campus Ministry office might send the message to some students that administrators favor certain ideologies over others.In the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting, students at Loyola University Chicago dedicated a week to the debunked \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d slogan that dominated much of the media coverage of the event.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

This means that Pepe now shares a home with the swastika, the confederate flag, white power pride.\u201d\u201cThe problem is, Pepe is not a symbol of hate. Pepe is a symbol of joy, of happiness, of friendship,\u201d they continued, before listing a variety of modified Pepe the Frog memes. \u201cYou and I cannot let reckless politicians abuse our innocent memes. Pepe deserves better. And with your help, we can clear Pepe\u2019s name, and make him happy for once.\u201d\u201cTweet #NotAllPepes,\u201d they encouraged. \u201cAnd together we can make the world a little greener.\u201dThe video ends with a song criticizing Hillary Clinton for branding Pepe the Frog a white supremacist icon, and numerous Twitter users have since gone on to tweet under the #NotAllPepes hashtag.Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign branded the cartoon frog a \u201csymbol of white supremacy,\u201d\u00a0basing their claims on\u00a0a Daily Beast interview with two notorious trolls\u00a0who have since mocked the author for falling for their claims.Clinton\u2019s claims have since been echoed by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, NBC\u2019s Katy Tur,\u00a0Heat Street\u2019s Louise Mensch and Ian Miles Cheong, and even the Anti-Defamation League, who added the cartoon frog into their Hate Symbol Database\u00a0alongside the Nazi swastika, the burning cross, and the Ku Klux Klan logo.Fans of Pepe the Frog have since rebelled against the mislabeling online, branding it a War on Memes, with SourceFed founder and popular YouTuber Philip DeFranco even joining in.\u201cI just think this is all a product of our insane political season,\u201d Anthony Fantano told\u00a0Breitbart Tech, before blaming Pepe\u2019s recent branding on notorious troll @JaredTSwift.\u201cThis is the guy the Hillary Pepe explainer labeled as \u2018a prominent white supremacist\u2019 when he\u2019s literally just an internet troll whose ilk are associating Pepe with right-wing imagery in order to take Pepe out of the mainstream and make him a more authentic, underground meme,\u201d he explained.\u201cNot a mission I agree with, because that\u2019s not really how memes work, but those on the left who are taking the bait don\u2019t seem to get it either,\u201d he continued. \u201cA cartoon frog that\u2019s been shared countless times on the Internet for years and years cannot suddenly become a symbol of hate. Especially not with the trolls actively \u2018rebranding\u2019 the meme are so few in number.\u201d\u201cHowever, now that the mainstream media is selling this narrative that Pepe is racist, more people are jumping on the bandwagon because Pepe being a symbol of white nationalism is now becoming a meme itself,\u201d Fantano claimed. \u201cThis was basically just the spark of a dumb idea being doused in gasoline by the left\u2019s never-ending search for anything they can label as \u2018racist.'\u201d\u201cAnd since there had previously been associations between Trump and Pepe, that gave them reason to take this edgy internet trolling seriously,\u201d he concluded.\u00a0\u201cIt was another opportunity to link Trump to bigots.\u201dCharlie Nash is a reporter\u00a0for\u00a0Breitbart Tech.

People in Pennsylvania have been alerted to possible attacks. There\u2019s a report of a secret meeting between the FBI and the voting officials in Florida. So this is serious enough we ought to start doing something about it.I\u2019ve outlined why there\u2019s at least five major factors which we\u2019re worried about, the so-called \u201cperfect storm,\u201d but I think maybe we should be talking also about what we can do about it because time is running out.There aren\u2019t too many things we can do. Some of the things we can do, we might want to do if we had more time, like getting some of them off the Internet, or making sure that the voting machines have an audit trail, or eliminating voting over the Internet \u2013 these are things we can\u2019t do in the remaining weeks. There are only a few things we can do.Marlow noted that the initial estimate of 12 state election systems assaulted by hackers was swiftly revised up to 23, which Banzhaf said was a sign that Homeland Security is taking the threat seriously, along with other cyber-warfare threats to \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d like electric power grids and water systems:For example, we\u2019ve been told that hackers might be able to take over nuclear power plants. They might be able to disable our entire financial system. They might be able to take over our electric grid. They might be able to shut down all of our aviation. Nobody can say that it\u2019s a five percent probability, or even a one percent probability, but given how serious it is, we have to pay attention. Bear in mind, again, you don\u2019t necessarily have to change the outcome of the election. All you\u2019ve got to do is create some kind of reasonable doubt about the validity of our presidential election. All you have to do is have one or two voting irregularities, particularly in close states like Ohio, for example. All you\u2019d need is for a screen to pop up and say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been hacked by blah blah blah blah.\u201dPeople could be worried, particularly if the losing candidate gets up and says, \u201cYeah, the election was stolen.\u201d If the American people lose confidence in our presidential election, we have a major constitutional crisis \u2013 which could be worse than grounding our airplanes for a day or screwing up our financial system for a day.Banzhaf cited a 2012 article that noted President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign had \u201crecruited a legion of lawyers to be on standby for this year\u2019s election, as legal disputes surrounding the voting process escalate.\u201d The article said that \u201cthousands of attorneys\u201d had agreed to provide \u201cmassive legal support that appears to be unrivaled by Republicans or precedent.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting, what I\u2019m thinking is likely to happen, is that each of the major parties, in addition to having lawyers standing by in case there are legal disputes, should possibly have their own volunteer cyber SWAT teams, or cyber-warriors, or whatever you want on standby,\u201d he said of the current election contest.\u201cI mean, if you get a report of a possible irregularity in a voting machine, or a possible tampering with the election process, that\u2019s not the time to get on the phone and start calling around to professors who teach computers,\u201d Banzhaf warned:You want to have people standing by. When you get a report of an irregularity, they should be ready to swoop in, to check for it, to preserve the digital evidence, to make sure it isn\u2019t tampered with. If their software has to be updated, for example, you want to have two people standing by: one for the Republicans, one for the Democrats, to make sure that they are legitimately uploading good software, not putting in some backdoor-type stuff.\u2026I think there ought to be, in addition to lawyers and election-watchers, there ought to be people who have skills in computers to be able to come in and take appropriate steps if irregularities are suspected or detected. I think it would be a very good idea for the federal government, with or without the states, to come out with some protocols and guidelines in terms of malware and firewall protection, and so on and so forth. Banzhaf said he had recently seen an article entitled \u201cHow to Hack an Election Machine,\u201d which discussed techniques such as \u201cdigital ballot stuffing,\u201d and suggested that \u201cif hackers are able to influence the data that is being pushed to the media, or on social media, through the election machines, they can potentially influence those still to vote, and thus the election, because voters tend to follow the poll leader.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to hack any election machine at all. If you got into the machines or the devices or the network that feeds the information to major networks, the mainstream media so-called, and you show X is running far ahead of Y,\u201d he explained, \u201cthat could influence the election right there,\u201d adding, \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of ways it could happen.\u201dBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.LISTEN:2016 Presidential Race, Radio, Tech, department of homeland security, election fraud, hackers, John BanzhafComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It recalled watching exchanges with the likes of Will Wright or Gabe Newell. There\u2019s a lot going on under the hood, nothing haphazard or erratic. He has Molyneux-esque ambition, but without the infamous Fable creator\u2019s penchant for empty claims and blustery\u00a0promises. He\u2019s measured, stubborn, and critical of everything \u2014 but none more so than himself.It was a refreshing conversation. Marketing fluff never entered the conversation, and amidst the thoughtful observations and bold design assertions was a dry wit and self-awareness that very few who attain such success manage to keep.This is the first of three parts\u00a0and focuses on Tynan\u2019s personal history, as well as the design philosophies he describes in his book, Designing Games: A Guide To Engineering Experiences.\u00a0Nate:\u00a0Let\u2019s start with your \u201corigin story.\u201d I understand\u00a0that you worked for Irrational on Bioshock Infinite?Tynan: Actually, the\u00a0more relevant part of my background comes long before Irrational. In fact, I actually started by doing modding for classic Unreal Tournament \u2014 the 1999 version \u2014 back in the day. And I was in high school when I was doing this. I used to make maps, and I made a full conversion mod I called \u201cElemental Conflict,\u201d and that is really where I started doing game development. Back then I was sort of working by myself, independently or with teams of people remotely, and that\u2019s kind of what I ended up doing in the end.So, that was the origin of it. Then, after a while, I went to university. I kept doing indie game projects on the side \u2014 really terrible ones, like I was just totally awful, but you know, just racking up the experience and trying to learn what was going on. After university, I went and I worked at\u00a0Irrational for 4 years, which was mostly spent on Bioshock Infinite, and I left a year before that game released. So I wasn\u2019t there right at the end, but I worked on systems design and weapon design and enemy design and a bunch of sort of random combat-oriented tasks.Ultimately, I found that working as one person in a studio with 100+ people wasn\u2019t that gratifying to me, personally. So, I really liked, you know, having the freedom to approach problems the way I wanted. I really liked the freedom to try different things, and\u00a0essentially solve things the way I thought they should be solved. So, I saved up some money and I quit.And I basically was just burning through my savings to try to build up prototypes for an indie game. I didn\u2019t know what it would be. I wrote a game design book at this time \u2014 which is partially to do something that I thought would have some significance for other people, and partially just as a learning project for myself \u2014 and I got it published with O\u2019Reilly Media. It\u2019s called Designing Games.And that, I think, was probably the event that I guess matured me as a game designer, and crystallized everything I\u2019d been trying to learn over the last ten years before that. Because I got to take it all, and actually write down my thoughts, instead of having them just this sort of foggy, blurry, swirly format in my head. And I think that really helped develop the tools that I used later on to make RimWorld and the methodologies.So, I quit. I finished the book. And then I started working on independent gaming designs and I made a sequence of prototypes. Each one took about a month. There was this zombie survivor game, where you had this group of survivors and you\u2019d go and try to survive in a zombie world. There was this mercenary management game, where it was this sort of business simulation of running a mercenary company. There was this game where you ran this, like, Hogwart\u2019s wizard school simulation, and a starship building game.Ultimately, I tried them all, and they didn\u2019t work as well as I wanted them to. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a tough decision to just\u00a0give up on a game you\u2019re working on, because you\u2019re like, \u201cIf I worked on it more, would it become fun, or is it just a dead concept in the first place?\u201dNate: And then there\u2019s that\u00a0whole \u201csunk cost\u201d feeling too, I\u2019m sure.Tynan: Yeah. It\u2019s brutal. And I just did this like five times in a row, month after month, throwing it out each time. So it\u2019s a tricky decision. And based on what I wrote in the book, it sort of crystallized my belief that a game design really sort of \u201chits\u201d or doesn\u2019t pretty early on. Like, it either works or it doesn\u2019t, in a very simple state.So, I kept changing it, and it turned out well because RimWorld \u2014 which was called \u201cEclipse Colony\u201d at the time, as its temporary development name \u2014 did work. I had a couple friends over at around\u00a010pm to play it \u2014 this was the first time anyone had played the game besides me \u2014 and it was still super simple. It was\u00a0just\u00a0yellow dots for the colonists, and very, very simplistic. And they wouldn\u2019t leave. They wouldn\u2019t stop playing for like four hours, and we all were falling asleep at like 2am before they would actually stop.So, that\u2019s when I kind of knew, \u201cYeah, this is going to work.\u201d I worked on it for like six more months and then put the Kickstarter out in late 2013, and I\u2019ve been working on RimWorld ever since.Nate:\u00a0You had mentioned the book, Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences. Out of curiosity, I dipped into it a bit myself.\u00a0It\u2019s probably the most interesting writing about game design theory that I\u2019ve ever read.Tynan: Glad to hear it!Nate: I think it\u2019s arguably more useful than something that gives specific technical tips, or instruction on how to accomplish a certain task, like the \u201cRight Way To Do Gun Progression.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s more like a thesis on the psychology of games and design. For the benefit of those who haven\u2019t yet taken a look, would you care to talk a bit about it?Tynan:\u00a0The basic thesis of the book is that the purpose of a game is to create an experience for the players. And the key aspect of any experience that makes it compelling is the emotions that you feel while you\u2019re having it. So, that\u2019s the core thread of the book \u2014 essentially, a guide to engineering experiences, which means a guide to creating systems, which is\u00a0really\u00a0what games are. Games are just\u00a0systems, like a computer system, or a mechanical system, like an old arcade pinball machine, or just sort of an abstract system, like a game you can play with words, or a game you play with pieces on a board.They\u2019re all just systems, but their purpose is the same, which is to create experiences with the people who are interacting with them, and to make those experiences compelling. Which means making those experiences emotional in some sense. So, that\u2019s the core idea of it, and the rest of it is essentially analyzing how to make this happen effectively using game design tools of almost any medium.Obviously I\u2019m a video game designer, but the principles are the same in board games or electro-mechanical \u201carcade\u201d games, or word games, or social games, or even other sort of experience-creation media, like if you\u2019re putting on a show for people. It\u2019s a very broad thing. It focuses on psychology because that\u2019s what games are about; you\u2019re sort of tweaking with the player\u2019s brain. You\u2019re creating this machine that the player\u2019s going to plug their brain into through their eyes and their hands, and the machine \u2014 the game \u2014 is going to try to make them feel something.So, you can make a game that targets different types of emotions. For example, if you make a horror game, you\u2019re looking for this mixture of jump scares and dread and interest and disgust. You\u2019re just trying to tweak people, right? Or if you\u2019re making like classic Minecraft, you\u2019re looking for this feeling of contented satisfaction, maybe intermixed with a little bit of trepidation about the night or threats that are coming after you, and a sense of sort of social humor that you would have if you were playing with your friends and make a big dick or something like that, you know?Nate: [laughs]\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t know anything about making a big dick in Minecraft. (This is\u00a0a bald-faced lie.)Tynan: So it\u2019s essentially taken that lens. And you can look at it as the core view I have of games, because it\u2019s the only one that I think applies universally. It\u2019s not like \u201chow to solve this narrow problem better,\u201d or like you mentioned making a better gun progression or something like that.You have to ask why you make a better gun progression, like what are you actually trying to accomplish here? Well, you\u2019re trying to create a nice set of emotions. So, if the gun progression is broken, it\u2019ll have big long periods where nothing happens, and then you\u2019re developing emotions of boredom. Or, it\u2019ll progress too quickly and leave players confused, which creates unpleasant senses of cognizant effort and a sense of being overwhelmed, which people don\u2019t tend to like.So, how do you make the \u201cright\u201d gun progression? Well, it\u2019s the one that gives you the emotions you want the player to have. And I think that that has been really key for RimWorld as well, because once you take this view, it\u2019s really about choosing the emotions you want, and then trying to create them. You can sort of step outside some of the assumptions that I think ruin a lot of games. Like, there\u2019s a very common assumption that games have to revolve around challenge and victory, which, you know, sports do tend to do, and so do these classic arcade games.But a lot of people, just at the core of what they say about games, is\u00a0the\u00a0core assumption \u2014 unquestioned and unconsidered \u2014 that it has to revolve around \u201ctriumph.\u201d Which is an emotion; triumph is a great emotion. But there\u2019s other experiences you can target as well. Which, you can\u2019t do with triumph, because not every emotion can go with every other emotion; they don\u2019t always mix, like in a dish, right? So sometimes you have to give up triumph.Nate: One emotion isn\u2019t compatible with every human experience.Tynan: Yeah, like you can\u2019t mix a horror game and this sort of happy children\u2019s building game and like this hardcore triumph game. They\u2019re different emotions; you\u2019re targeting different things.Nate: Do you feel like that\u2019s lacking in the AAA space?Tynan: Definitely. I mean, they\u2019re quite risk-averse. Some of them get into it. But it\u2019s a very slow progression. I think indie is really where all of the interesting experiments are going to happen, which is obvious because indie is where you\u2019re not spending $50 million dollars.Nate: Right. Same with music and film; the indie scene tends to push forward change.Tynan: Yeah, pretty much. And that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s why you see games like Abzu recently, where there\u2019s no triumph, there\u2019s no challenge, you just sort of go around and feel the atmosphere and the ambiance, swimming, and this beautiful underwater space, and various other experimental indie games. And then there\u2019s a million details of how to actually \u201coperationalize\u201d that, and actually apply it, and kind of develop the sense for \u2026 you know, when I was pushing too hard, or how to feel those emotions that most people don\u2019t feel.I think one of the most interesting subsections\u00a0of the book is that\u00a0it talks about the emotions that people don\u2019t realize they have. I think most people, when they think \u201cemotion,\u201d they think of tearful crying sessions, or a huge sense of overwhelming triumph. But the reality is, emotions are very fine-grained and they\u2019re hitting you all the time at every moment.Like from one half-second to the next, your emotions will change.\u00a0A cat jumps out of a box. First it\u2019s two seconds of curiosity, followed by one second of confused anticipation when the box makes a noise, followed by a half second of fear when the cat jumps out, followed by a few seconds of exhilaration mixed with fright, followed by this sort of cuddly happiness.And that\u2019s like \u2014 you\u2019re going through like seven or eight emotions within ten seconds, right? Which I think is fascinating. When you\u2019re doing a game design, you want to analyze it on that level, a very fine-grained level. And you can! It\u2019s interesting, and you can create a worthwhile experience using that. So it\u2019s not just academic either, which I find really compelling.Nate:\u00a0Speaking of \u00a0things \u201cacademic,\u201d I noticed in one of the Reddit AMAs you said you learned basically nothing in school about creating games, and that a lot of it came just by doing it, by personal experience. Do you think that higher education is a valuable thing to pursue when getting into games, or do you think that\u2019s just adding empty debt to something you\u2019re just going to have to do on your own anyway?Tynan: I think it depends what you want to do. You know, for study in technology or art, there\u2019s some great programs. And if you want to be a really hardcore programmer or a really great artist, I think it\u2019s possible to do those on your own, but I think there are also good programs. I\u2019m not an expert in that field, but I think in terms of game design, like actual game design \u2014 not like \u201cwe\u2019re going to call it game design but it\u2019s actually programming\u201d \u2014 but in actual game design, I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything out there.It\u2019s just not a mature field. And it\u2019s a field that\u2019s so immature that there\u2019s almost zero supply of game designers, there\u2019s almost no public knowledge of what it\u2019s really about, or any general comprehension that this is something that exists, and it is distinct from programming. Half of these game design programs are really just coding programs, and the general level of knowledge is so low and so concentrated in those few people that are actually doing it, who are still doing it, that I really don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any worthwhile game design programs that I\u2019ve seen or heard of.I think that anyone who wants to get into it would be far better served doing it on their own. That said, I could be wrong. This is obviously advice tailored from me, and I\u2019m a very independence-minded person. Someone who wants to work in a big company or is more social like that might get more out of it, but from what I\u2019ve seen there\u2019s really nothing there. The people who learn to do it have learned to do it by doing it, and they\u2019re still doing it because this industry is really only a few decades old and we really haven\u2019t had time for people to get old and write their retirement books yet, you know? It\u2019s going to take a century before it really matures, you know?Nate: That\u2019s a very\u00a0good point.Tynan: So, like, even when computers were invented, they still came from mathematical principles that had existed before. But in terms of game design, it\u2019s sort of trying to bootstrap off of movies or programming. It\u2019s like you\u2019re bootstrapping off of programming, which is a completely different field, so it\u2019s just this really fucked up \u2014 it\u2019s in this really fucked up state. So I think it\u2019s going to take fifty or a hundred years before there\u2019s really a mature education system. Because we need two generations of people to retire and write their books and so on and so forth. That\u2019s my opinion.Nate:\u00a0You\u2019ve said that you learned a lot in the course of writing the book. What are some of the things that it taught you?Tynan:\u00a0That\u2019s something that\u2019s really hard to describe, right? Because it\u2019s like knowledge that you had beforehand \u2014 like, how do you organize your own knowledge? Before I wrote the book, I would describe the state of my mind as having a huge amount of reference experiences \u2014 by which I mean, memories of things that\u2019d happened, or games I\u2019d played, or experiences I\u2019d had working at Irrational, or things I\u2019d tried in making games that worked or didn\u2019t work.I had tons of those \u201creference experiences,\u201d because I\u2019d been doing this for years and years. I had all these games I\u2019d played, I had a ton of thoughts and ideas about how they should work, I had a huge amount of advice that I\u2019d heard, or just design articles I\u2019d read. But it was all just sloshing around in my brain without a system of organization.I think writing the book, for me, was beneficial because it allowed me to take all that knowledge and crystallize it into a structure I could really work with, and really use to sort of prioritize things, or know when to reference one experience over another, or when one concept should connect to another or override another, and so on and so forth.It\u2019s exceptionally hard to describe, this sort of learning, because it\u2019s not like a fact-oriented learning, or episodic learning, it really is an incredibly intuitive thing. It\u2019s the difference between, you know, ten years ago or even a few years ago if I looked at a game design problem and you just asked me what we should do, I would just give a totally different answer from now. But in either case, can I really explain why the answer is different? So, it\u2019s a very tacit knowledge thing. I\u2019m sorry if this answer is unsatisfying.Nate: Not at all. There\u2019s a lot to digest! A lot of people are struggling to learn the same things you have.Tynan: I think that for anyone working on their game design skill, writing about it, and really working at writing about it and releasing those articles, is essential. So, I\u2019ve written on Gamasutra as well, I\u2019ve written design articles which were also helpful and anyone can read for free. I\u2019d totally recommend that.There\u2019s a design article on Gamasutra called \u201cThe Simulation Dream,\u201d which is the last one I wrote a few years ago, a little bit before I made RimWorld actually. And you can really see the connection to RimWorld from that article. It\u2019s sort of a taste of the kind of thing my book tends to say.\u00a0In part 2 of the interview, we discuss the indie gaming scene, VR,\u00a0and the future of the gaming industry at large.Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church\u00a0@Get2Church\u00a0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Tech, RimWorld, Tynan Sylvester, video gamesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Naturally part of this class was using the vocabulary and grammar learned to create sentences. During one class Sweetwood referred to himself as handsome using the Chinese phrase, \u201cW\u01d2 h\u011bn shu\u00e0i\u201d. Sweetwood thought nothing of this, finished the class and went home. The next day however Sweetwood was asked to stay after class by his professor, in Sweetwood\u2019s own words, this is how the exchange went.\u201cShe mentioned I had called myself handsome and alluded to my joking personality in general. She also told me she was not offended at all. She said she thought it was funny, but that she didn\u2019t want to get in trouble herself. She told me if I want to make those jokes, I should come to her office hours to do so. I assumed it\u2019s because my sick mind needed to be contained in a space where other students were not at risk of harm. I felt bad for the teacher as she seemed to be in a tough situation, where she had no choice but to scold me.\u201dSweetwood received an email from Columbia University\u2019s dean later in the day informing him that he had been reported to the \u201cGender-Based Misconduct Office\u201d and would need to meet with the dean as soon as possible. Sweetwood did meet with the dean who attempted to make him admit fault in the situation, Sweetwood refused.\u201cMy dean tried to make me agree that I would never do this again. I flat out refused. I laid into her about how upset I was about the situation and I said something along the lines of: \u2018If you\u2019re asking me to not be myself, then I guarantee I will end up back in your office again.\u2019\u201dThe Dean did however seem to concede that the reaction to Sweetwoods comments may have been over the top, at one point saying, \u201cEven if I agree with you, I obviously couldn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d.This eventually led to Sweetwood being forced to discuss the matter with a caseworker from the Gender-Based Misconduct Office who set up a \u201cre-education\u201d meeting in his office. Once Sweetwood explained what happened and his general views on gender based attacks and homophobia, the caseworker seemed to lighten up, once again echoing the deans sentiment saying, \u201cEven if I were to agree with you, you know I can\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d.The case was eventually dismissed but Sweetwood didn\u2019t miss his chance to let the classmate that reported him know how he felt about the situation.\u00a0\u201cLater that week, in Chinese class when my teacher was having us use a new sentence structure to talk about things that make us upset, my sentence was: \u201cI get upset when I get reported to Gender Misconduct by my classmates (OK, I may have used a little bit of English to get the full phrase out). I probably shouldn\u2019t have done that but it was just too damn funny not to.\u201dRead Sweetwood\u2019s full article at The Tab here.Lucas Nolan is a conservative who regularly contributes articles on censorship and free speech to Breitbart.

Street1 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, who had quietly dabbled in venture capital through investments in the music streaming service Tidal, WTRMLN WTR beverage company and the vegan-based 22 Day Nutrition, has decided to lend her celebrity visibility by becoming a seed round investor in Sidestep, a company that is using tech fulfillment to leverage the booming trade in concert memorabilia.The first half of 2016 saw the worst year for music sales since 1991, according to data analysts at Nielsen Music Ratings. Album sales, including track-equivalent albums (TEA, whereby 10 track sales equal one album unit) were down 16.9 percent; album units overall fell 13.6 percent to 100.3 million total sales; compact disc continued to crumble by wilting 11.6 percent to about 50 million; and digital album sales fell by almost 20 percent to 43.8 million. The only good news was vinyl sales moved up by 11.4 percent from a low base to 6.2 million units.But in contrast to the crashing recorded-music business, the live concert business has never been bigger. Artists at every level are becoming more and more on concert revenues as their primary source of income as 2015 was up 14 percent to a record year for the North American concert business with the total gross hitting $3.12 billion on 42.08 million tickets sold by just the Top 100 tours. More importantly, the average ticket price has also moved up in 2016 by 4 percent to $74.25.Beyonc\u00e9 began her 39-date Formation World Tour on April 27, 2016, at Marlins Field in Miami and will finish at the New York Giant\u2019s stadium in the Meadowlands on October 7. As the top female attraction on the planet, she is on track to sell over $200 million in ticket sales.But artists like Beyonc\u00e9 also gets a cut of about 30 percent of gross tour merchandise sales. That percentage could be much higher, but venues\u00a0always get their 20+ percent of the merchandise in their facilities. It is not unusual for concert goers to spend more on t-shirts, posters and other collectors\u2019 items they paid in ticket prices.The ability to cut out the overhead charge by the venues, explains why after the first two weeks of Sidestep selling Beyonc\u00e9 tour merchandise online at her shows, she decided to have her Parkwood management company become an angel investor in Sidestep.Sidestep CEO Eric Jones told the TecCrunch.com blog that they \u201cwanted Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s tour to be very focused on tech\u201d, and liked the idea of \u201ca tiny scrappy startup doing the biggest tour in the world.\u201dThe start-up allows concert attendees to \u201csidestep\u201d long lines at remote booths and use a smartphone app to order tour merchandise before, during, or even after a show. The concert goer that places an order online receives QR code that they can use at a dedicated pickup spot or can have products delivered directly to their home.Sidestep only makes a 10 percent service fee they charge to their customer, which means the artist gets the full merchandise revenue minus only shipping and handling costs. Artists like Beyonc\u00e9, also get a piece of the action if an attendee at one of her concerts decides to buy some other artist\u2019s merchandise, including name stars like Guns N\u2019 Roses, Fall Out Boy, Selena Gomez, and Weezer that have Sidestep agreements.Beyonc\u00e9 joined actor Jared Leto, former Lady Gaga manager Troy Carter and his Cross Culture Ventures, and the previous CEO of the LA Dodgers to raise a total of $1.7 million for the company. Sidestep is reported to have grown revenues to over $2 million this year, up from $200,000 in 2015.The visibility of having a celebrity like Beyonc\u00e9, helped the Sidestep qualify to compete in\u00a0TechCrunch\u2019s 1st And Future sports startup hackathon\u00a0in early 2016.Big Hollywood, Breitbart California, Tech, \"Formation World Tour\", Beyonce, celebrity venture capital, concert, Meadowlands, Sidestep, tour merchandiseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Although the fee was ultimately paid, administrators allowed student protesters to disrupt and derail the event without intervention from security.The administration denied an attempt by the student group to plan a second event featuring Yiannopoulos.

Pollak1 Oct 20160Along the way, Napolitano attacks the University of Chicago\u2019s so-called \u201cfree speech Darwinism\u201d \u2014 a term she uses to\u00a0defame, but does not bother to define.Napolitano\u2019s university system is rife with the suppression of free speech and academic freedom, both in an official capacity (and, more worryingly, by students themselves). Last year, the University of California circulated a list of terms that it called \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d that faculty should avoid, and which included such controversial statements as\u00a0\u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity,\u201d \u201cThere is only one race, the human race,\u201d and \u201cI believe the most qualified person should get the job.\u201dIn her op-ed, Napolitano offers up familiar free speech\u00a0mantras: \u201c[T]he way to deal with extreme, unfounded speech is not with less speech \u2014 it is with more speech,\u201d she says. Yet she also\u00a0claims, erroneously, that speech \u201cdesigned to personally intimidate or harass falls outside First Amendment protections, as outlined by the Supreme Court.\u201dThat is\u00a0more restrictive\u00a0than the actual boundary of\u00a0free speech\u00a0established by the Court, and it is a definition that the campus left has exploited\u00a0by defining\u00a0\u201cintimidation\u201d and \u201charassment\u201d expansively,\u00a0to\u00a0shut down opposing (or insufficiently radical) views on campus.Napolitano also defends \u201csafe spaces\u201d by distorting what they are. She calls them \u201cstudent centers and student activities,\u201d implying that they are meant to be inclusive. In fact, \u201csafe spaces\u201d are exclusive, designed to keep out unwelcome views or people.She also says that \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d are little more than a professor telling students \u201cthat a piece they are about to study explores the difficult topic of race,\u201d which \u201chelps students appreciate what they are reading.\u201d In fact, \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d do the opposite: they tell students that they should regard what they are about to read or hear with suspicion, fear and hostility.The capstone of Napolitano\u2019s intellectually dishonest \u201cdefense\u201d of free speech is her accusation that the University of Chicago is engaged in \u201cfree speech Darwinism.\u201d Napolitano is referring to a letter sent by that university\u2019s dean to incoming students, informing them that while debate on campus must be civil, they can also expect it to be challenging, and that it is not the job of the university to protect students from uncomfortable ideas or diverse views with \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings.\u201dThe letter says nothing about \u201cfree speech Darwinism,\u201d which Napolitano appears to have invented. If she means that only ideas that pass the tests of reason and debate will survive, there can be no objection to the term: that is the job of a university, in teaching and research.But what Napolitano actually appears to be doing is linking\u00a0free speech with social Darwinism, a nineteenth century movement that the left often\u00a0uses to caricature\u00a0capitalism and meritocracy\u00a0as ruthless and predatory. By inference, she is signaling\u00a0that arguments defending the free market and free competition should\u00a0not enjoy\u00a0equal tolerance.And so what Napolitano is really doing is not defending free speech, but defending restrictions on\u00a0conservative views by left-wing dons.Notably, when Napolitano cites an example of offensive speech, she finds a way to attack Donald Trump: \u201cChalking an anti-immigrant pro-Trump slogan on a sidewalk is one thing; spray painting it on a building is another.\u201dThe latter has never happened\u00a0\u2014 but there are plenty of examples of left-wing vandalism in the Black Lives Matter vein, which universities have chosen to tolerate. Napolitano\u2019s call for \u201cfree speech\u201d is really a manifesto for more suppression on campus.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

It is respectful to make a reasonable effort to refer to students in the way that they prefer.\u201dHowever he said that he does have a problem with the university making arbitrary pronouns an official university policy, so he said he should now be addressed as \u201cHis Majesty, Grant Strobl.\u201dHe has consequently urged students to go on to the university intranet and \u201cinsert the identity of their dreams.\u201dMy new identity is His Majesty Grant Strobl, what's yours?

Together, Deakin University of Melbourne and Harvard University have developed HeroSurg, the first surgical robot to give operators a remote\u00a0sense of touch using haptic technology.The team also had assistance from acclaimed Australian surgeon and Royal Adelaide Hospital\u2019s Professor Suren Krishnan, as well as lead researcher Dr.\u00a0Mohsen Moradi Dalvand.Dalvand has nearly a decade of experience in medical robotics and haptic technology, which provides physical\u00a0feedback to users to simulate a sense of touch (the rumble feature of video game controllers, for example). He defined the robot as a \u201cmaster and slave\u201d system: \u201cOn the \u2018slave\u2019 side, it has multiple robotic arms with instruments and laparoscope. On the \u2018master\u2019 side, we have haptic-enabled handles for the surgeons to operate the instruments.\u201d\u201cIf the surgeon is grasping something using the instruments, or if they\u2019re cutting the tissue, they can feel the amount of force they are applying to the tissue,\u201d said the researcher. \u201cWhen you have the ability to measure or feel the interaction forces \u2026 you can touch the instruments and feel how stiff [the tissues] are, how soft they are, to what extent the tissues are normal or abnormal.\u201dIn a statement, Krishnan explained the magnitude of the sense of touch during laparoscopic procedures. \u201cThe major drawback of the current system is the lack of tactile feedback,\u201d he noted. \u201cTactile feedback allows a surgeon to differentiate between tissues and to \u2018feel\u2019 delicate tissues weakened by infection or inflammation and dissect them more carefully. Tactile feedback will allow us to use finer and more delicate sutures in microsurgery.\u201dIn addition to fine-tuning robotic microsurgery, Dalvand believes HeroSurg will \u201covercome many of the limitations of existing robotic laparoscopic systems,\u201d and that the robot\u2019s unique features, including automatic collision avoidance, high-res 3D imagery, and further range of motion, \u201cwill assist surgeons to perform demanding surgical procedures with comfort, accuracy, and safety by providing real-time collision avoidance for medical instruments, and stereo-endoscopic vision.\u201dFollowing laboratory testing by medical experts, the team is moving the system forward to human trials, with hopes of introducing the device into Australia\u2019s public health system within a few years. Dalvand even sees\u00a0the potential for HeroSurg to be used remotely, allowing surgeons and patients to be thousands of miles apart \u2014 in hospitals, prisons, or war zones.Medicine, Tech, HeroSurg, RobotsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Apple Is Logging Your iMessage Contacts, Could Give Data to Police", "id": "post-5143906", "content": "by John Hayward29 Sep 20160The document is summarized as follows:Apple maintains a log of phone\u00a0numbers you\u2019ve entered into Messages and potentially elsewhere on an\u00a0Apple device, like the Contacts app, even if you never end up communicating with those people. The document implies that\u00a0Messages\u00a0transmits these numbers to Apple when you open a new chat window and select a contact or number with whom to communicate, but it\u2019s unclear exactly when these queries are triggered, and how often \u2014 an Apple spokesperson confirmed only that the logging information in the iMessage FAQ is \u201cgenerally accurate,\u201d but declined to elaborate on the record.In other words, Apple has some idea of who each user has attempted to communicate with, or at least added to your contact list. The date and time this contract information was entered is also recorded, along with the device\u2019s IP address at that time \u2013 which, it is noted, could allow the general location of the device to be determined, despite Apple\u2019s promises to the contrary. The log is only retained by Apple\u2019s system for 30 days.The Intercept\u00a0includes the statement Apple issued in response:When law enforcement presents us with a valid subpoena or court order, we provide the\u00a0requested\u00a0information\u00a0if it is\u00a0in our possession.\u00a0Because iMessage\u00a0is\u00a0encrypted end-to-end, we\u00a0do not have access to the\u00a0contents of\u00a0those\u00a0communications.\u00a0In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on\u00a0their devices. We work closely with law enforcement to help them understand what we can provide and make clear these query logs don\u2019t contain the contents of conversations or\u00a0prove\u00a0that any communication actually took place.Questions remain about how often these contact logs are updated, and most pertinently, why Apple is logging the information at all.The Intercept\u00a0judges this revelation \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily undermine the company\u2019s posturing (and record) as a guardian of privacy,\u201d but zings Apple for not forthrightly explaining how the tracking system works to their customers, who had to wait for a media organization to obtain a FAQ sheet from a police department to learn about it.\u201cSure, the app doesn\u2019t collect your message contents, but Apple hasn\u2019t been entirely transparent about how private its messaging service really is, while vehemently claiming that Messages leaves no trace of your communications,\u201d The Next Web complains. \u201cIt isn\u2019t clear why the company needs to store this data; doing so only seems to make it a point of investigation for law enforcement and undermines the promise of privacy in Messages.\u201dApple has famously scrapped with law enforcement over its refusal to compromise customers\u2019 privacy or unlock encrypted data, earning credibility in the eyes of electronic privacy advocates, and an equal level of concern from those who worry that unbreakable encryption can be a valuable tool for terrorists and organized crime.9to5Mac argues that the\u00a0Intercept\u00a0story is unfair to Apple, citing legal documents that prove\u00a0\u201cApple has already made it clear a number of times that it stores contact information.\u201dAlso, there are already a number of apps that keep more comprehensive IP address logs than iMessage, which can be given to law enforcement, and IP addresses are a very inexact took for determining physical location in any event.\u201cSo\u00a0Apple\u2019s servers do log some contact related info for the company\u2019s own debugging purposes and to route some messages to the right service (SMS or Apple\u2019s Messages platform) when that info is needed \u2014 that\u2019s what makes iMessage work the way\u00a0it does with\u00a0switching between SMS and iMessage on the fly. It keeps the data for 30 days before deleting it, and it does make some data available to law enforcement with proper warrants, but it has been clear about disclosing that to customers,\u201d 9to5Mac concludes.Law Enforcement, Tech, Apple, law enforcement, text messagingComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But now it has to reach a point of intolerable. We cannot tolerate this. Lives are being lost.\u201dBut what about suspects cooperating with the police and not escalating matters by being combative? Wouldn\u2019t that help cut down on police shootings? Breitbart Sports asked Baldwin, after Sunday\u2019s Seahawks-Jets game, if any of the blame for police shootings lies with non-cooperative suspects who endanger police.\u201cThat is a non sequitur,\u201d Baldwin responded. \u201cYou are not even following the premise when you ask that question. The reason why that is not even a conversation is law enforcement are given consent. You can Google it. Basically what it says is that they are agents of our government. We give them authority to govern us. So, if an agent of the government is not following the laws and policies or is not well-trained or not getting sufficient training to handle citizens who are not professionally obligated to protect communities, are not professionally obligated to protect communities like law enforcement are, that is where the issue lies.\u201cYes, we can talk about crime in general, but it\u2019s not my neighbor\u2019s job to protect me. It\u2019s law enforcement\u2019s job to protect me, so I want to provide them with the best resources, best tools, best training, so they can go out there themselves in a better manner, protect the communities they serve and ultimately protect their reputation.\u201dBut what about life-threatening situations in which a cop making the wrong split-second decision with an armed suspect could lose his life?\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult job; I\u2019m not taking away from that,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult and dangerous job, but that\u2019s what they signed up for. When you sign up to be a police officer you are consenting to be in those situations. You might not always be in that situation. You might not ever be in that situation, but you are consenting, you know it comes with an inherent risk, so when you are in those situations, you have to lean on your training, lean on your understanding to get yourself through those situations, so you can come home in a safe manner.\u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy to do that, but what I\u2019m saying, what I\u2019m more concerned about is providing better training, better resources, better tools for our law enforcement, so they can make those split-second decisions and make them in a manner where not only is the criminal or the person they have the encounter with can go home safely, but also themselves can go home safely.\u201dBreitbart Sports, Breitbart TV, Law Enforcement, Doug BaldwinComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I do not think he is a serious contender, but, if the Tide roll and others falter he may find himself in the conversation if it becomes a \u201cbest player on the best team\u201d contest.8. QB Seth Russell (Baylor)\u2014A poor performance by the signal caller and his team still has both surviving in the Heisman and playoff hunt. Russell will need some big numbers to remain a part of the dark horse conversation.7. QB Trevor Knight (TAMU)\u2014It was not Knight\u2019s best game, but he played a critical role in the win over South Carolina. Upcoming contests against Tennessee and Alabama could vault him up the list a bit.6. RB Christian McCaffrey (Stanford)\u2014The Huskies figured out the formula to shut down the elite stat-accumulating machine. Sadly, McCaffrey\u2019s geography, lack of big remaining games, and strength of competition make it unlikely he becomes a real factor in this race.5. QB Jake Browning (Washington)\u2014There is quite a drop off between #4 and #5, but Browning is in a spot to make a run after his team routed Stanford.4. QB Greg Ward (Houston)\u2014In most years, Ward\u2019s case would look better, but his spot outside of the Power 5 in a year of elite dual-threat quarterbacks makes him more forgettable.2b. QB Deshaun Watson (Clemson)\u2014Three interceptions take the luster off an otherwise strong performance by Watson. I think Barrett is in a slightly better position as the alternative to Jackson, but both quarterbacks are in a much better position this week.2a. QB JT Barrett (Ohio State)\u2014Now the all-time Ohio State leader in passing TDs, Barrett has not put up massive numbers this season, but he will have opportunities to shine.1. QB Lamar Jackson (Louisville)\u2014Jackson lost the game, but he did not lose his lead in the Heisman race. While this is now a closer contest, the numbers Jackson is putting up will make him tough to beat. His Cardinals still could land a playoff spot, but, if they falter, that could open up an opportunity for Watson or Barrett.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

UPI reports that Notre Dame officials are in talks with North Carolina State as well as Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner John Swofford over the game this weekend. The teams are carefully watching the storm and will make a decision in the 24 hours before the game.As for the bout between the University of South Carolina Gamecocks and the Georgia Bulldogs, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has already called for evacuations in her state and feels the game will not be played at home.South Carolina coach Will Muschamp noted that he is working with the SEC on alternate plans if the storm hits South Carolina hard enough to impact the game. Coach Muschamp, though, stressed that the game is his most important concern.\u201cOur administration is handling all that through the SEC office,\u201d Muschamp said. \u201cAll of my energy is game planning for the game.

The Big 12 standard bearer, Baylor, survived, though barely. Alternating games between Alabama, Tennessee, and Texas A&M will determine a pecking order in that conference. Clemson now has the lead in the ACC, but Louisville won\u2019t go away. Meanwhile, the OSU-Michigan rivalry looms even larger in the Big 10. Houston, also, sits pretty outside of the Power 5. Still, any number of upsets could drastically change the whole picture. There\u2019s still a lot of great college football to be played with Virginia Tech at UNC, Tennessee at Texas A&M, and Alabama at Arkansas being the top contests this week.Receiving consideration: Auburn, Florida State, North Dakota State, UCLA, Air Force, Georgia, LSU, Arizona State, Indiana, and Maryland.25. Utah 4-1 [Lost to Cal, Last Week #17]\u2014Cal has quickly emerged as one of the more inconsistent yet potentially potent teams in the nation. The Utes learned that the hard way and need a bounce back win over Arizona.24. Virginia Tech 3-1 [Bye, Last Week NR]\u2014If the Hokies can win at UNC, they could be poised for big things in Justin Fuente\u2019s first year.23. Colorado 4-1 [Defeated Oregon State, Last Week NR]\u2014It has been a while since the Buffaloes were relevant. A game at USC will help determine how long they stay that way.22. West Virginia 4-0 [Defeated Kansas State, Last Week NR]\u2014The Mountaineers have not looked strong, but they find themselves in the strong position of being undefeated in a weak conference.21. Western Michigan 5-0 [Defeated Central Michigan, Last Week NR]\u2014Coach PJ Fleck is one of my favorite up and comers, and his team looks ready to dominate in the MAC.20. North Carolina 4-1 [Defeated Florida state, Last Week NR]\u2014It is tough to evaluate the Tar Heels as they have struggled in games and the loss to UGA to start the season looks worse. Still, they have found their stride offensively, and games against Virginia Tech and at Miami these next two weeks could decide the division.19. Boise State 4-0 [Defeated Utah State, Last Week #24]\u2014With the SDSU losing, I now see the Broncos as perhaps the team most likely to go undefeated.18. Florida 4-1 [Defeated Vanderbilt, Last Week #18]\u2014The Gators were rooting for Georgia over UT, and had to be disappointed by the result. Still, they need to look inward after struggling against Vandy.17. Arkansas 4-1 [Defeated Alcorn State, Last Week #22]\u2014It will be a tough stretch ahead for the Hogs who host Alabama, Ole Miss, and visit Auburn. Bret Bielema could have his team in a strong position or find himself on a mildly warm seat at the end of this stretch.16. Oklahoma 2-2 [Defeated TCU, Last Week #21]\u2014A nice bounce back win for the Sooners could set the tone for the rest of the season. The Big 12 is ripe for the taking.15. Stanford 3-1 [Lost to Washington, Last Week #7]\u2014It was a humiliating evening for the Cardinal who likely said goodbye to their playoff hopes.14. Nebraska 5-0 [Defeated Illinois, Last Week #16]\u2014The Cornhuskers should have handled Illinois with greater ease, but I still see this as a team that should enter a visit to Wisconsin 7-0.13. Ole Miss 3-2 [Defeated Memphis, Last Week #15]\u2014The Rebels got revenge against Memphis, and they now have a bye before a tough stretch that sees them visit Arkansas and LSU before hosting Auburn at home.12. Baylor 5-0 [Defeated Iowa State, Last Week #14]\u2014It took a late rally, but the Bears beat the lowly Cyclones. They get a week off to regroup, but they still look like the class of a weak Big 12.11. Miami 4-0 [Defeated Georgia Tech, Last Week #12]\u2014Frankly, we know very little about this Hurricane team. I like Richt, and there is talent on this roster. However, we will learn about the quality of this squad after matchups against Florida State and UNC followed by a short week trip to Blacksburg.10. Wisconsin 4-1 [Lost to Michigan, Last Week #9]\u2014I hate to only \u201cpunish\u201d a losing team by dropping them one spot, but you simply cannot make the argument based on this young season that the Badgers are not a top ten team. Wisconsin has two weeks to prepare for Ohio State.9. Tennessee 5-0 [Defeated Georgia, Last Week #11]\u2014Does this team have any miraculous comebacks left? Firmly in the SEC East driver\u2019s seat, the Vols play at Texas A&M and get Alabama at home in consecutive weeks. Winning one of those games will keep this team in the playoff picture.8. Texas A&M 5-0 [Defeated South Carolina, Last Week #8]\u2014Sumlin\u2019s team struggled against a weak South Carolina squad, and that is cause for concern. Still, this team could rapidly rise with wins over Tennessee at home and then at Alabama, a crucial game to be played after an Aggie bye week.7. Louisville 4-1 [Lost to Clemson, Last Week #2]\u2014The Cardinals fought back on the road against a Clemson team that pushed for the title a year ago. Smart money is on this team, if they win out, to be in the playoff.6. Washington 5-0 [Defeated Stanford, Last Week #10]\u2014The Huskies put any doubts about their legitimacy to rest with a rout of Stanford. Chris Petersen has his program in the driver\u2019s seat in the PAC 12.5. Michigan 5-0 [Defeated Wisconsin, Last Week #6]\u2014The potent Wolverines offense came to a screeching halt against Wisconsin, but this team managed to beat a really tough Badgers squad.4. Houston 5-0 [Defeated UCONN, Last Week #4]\u2014Many will begin waffling on the Cougars, but, if they win out with a schedule that still includes Louisville, they will be in the playoff.3. Clemson 5-0 [Defeated Louisville, Last Week #5]\u2014Deshaun Watson and company have yet to regain their late-season form from a year ago, but they managed to defeat a very good Louisville team. The Tigers play at Florida State on October 29 following a bye. That game, no longer particularly daunting, may be the toughest left on the schedule.2. Ohio State 4-0 [Defeated Rutgers, Last Week #3]\u2014Rutgers is no powerhouse, but Ohio State defeating a Power 5 team 58-0 sends a statement. The Buckeyes look strong.1. Alabama 5-0 [Defeated Kentucky, Last Week: #1]\u2014After coasting for the last two weeks, Alabama heads into the toughest stretch of its schedule with games at Arkansas, at Tennessee, and against Texas A&M. I still see no reason not to expect the Tide to run the table.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

After all, the victims of these crimes would certainly qualify as \u201coppressed\u201d and there are obviously many \u201cbodies in the street\u201d attesting to this. At the epicenter of the tragic black-on-black crime wave is Chicago. According to the Chicago Tribune, there have been 568 homicides this year, 172 more than this time last year. An African American protestor, wearing a gorilla suit and a \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d shirt with \u201cPut Down the Guns\u201d on the back, ran onto Soldier Field this weekend to bring attention to the issue.Breitbart Sports finally got an NFL player to address the perceived double-standard of the protesting players, who blast police actions in dealing with suspects but nary a word on black-on-black crime.Breitbart Sports asked Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin, after Sunday\u2019s Seahawks-Jets game, about the black-on-black crime issue. Baldwin, the son of a police officer, supports Kaepernick.\u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s crime \u2013 black-on-black crime, white-on-white crime, it\u2019s crime,\u201d Baldwin pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s citizens of this country, it\u2019s crime. So first and foremost, you have to take the racist/bigotry goggles off and see that it\u2019s just crime. Second of all, it\u2019s about proximity. Blacks live near blacks, so when you have crime, it\u2019s going to be in those vicinities, just like it is with white crime, crime in general.\u201dBaldwin, who joined the 1,000-yard receiving club last season, captured the nation\u2019s attention when he squatted down in the end zone after scoring a touchdown in Super Bowl 49 and dropped the ball between his legs. He now seeks to attract positive attention as a social-justice activist.\u201cIf we are going to talk specifically about black-on-black crime, in those communities, why are those communities that way?\u201d he asked on Sunday. \u201cAfrican Americans, black people, they didn\u2019t happen to grow up that way, they didn\u2019t just happen to be planted in the United States that way. One-hundred and fifty years ago, it was okay to own a slave, right? So the same reason why we see that the athletic sports are dominated by black people, so the generations of that heritage hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, you are seeing the result of the greatest athletes in the world being 150 years ago as slaves. Now you are saying you want all of this to change?\u201cIn 150 years, it\u2019s not going to change. It\u2019s going to take time.\u201dBaldwin took the time to meet with Seattle police officers on Monday. He leads something called the \u201cBuilding Bridges Task Force\u201d for the Seahawks. He aims for police retraining on a national basis.He says the problems in urban communities mainly stem from external forces.\u201cThe process isn\u2019t just saying they need to educate themselves, they need to get out of it, they need to not be entitled, which is the argument I continue to hear,\u201d Baldwin maintains. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about a process. Two-hundred-and-fifty-six years Africans were enslaved, it\u2019s only been 150 years since slavery was abolished.

In recent years, the league has enforced a ban, in effect at its venues everywhere but its two Texas stadiums, on firearms, even those carried by off-duty police officers.

He likely did so not to escape the consequences of Texas Justice but but to elude the punishment of the harsher, one-man law at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan.

He says he\u2019s been a teetotaler in October thus far.\u201cIt\u2019s been a witch hunt ever since I won that world title,\u201d the Gypsy King told Rolling Stone, \u201cbecause of my background, because of who I am and what I do \u2013 there\u2019s hatred for Travelers and gypsies around the world.\u201dFury insists, \u201cI\u2019ll never be accepted for who I am and what I am.\u201dThe towering heavyweight defeated Wladimir Klitschko in convincing if boring fashion last November. His handlers called off two subsequent rematches, the most recent cancellation came after the failed drug test but before its publication. They said their charge suffers from mental-health issues, which Fury cops to in the interview.The Mancunian says he hasn\u2019t trained since the spring, now weighs 290 pounds, drinks and does cocaine on a near-constant basis, and battles depression and a form of bi-polar disorder. He claims he currently receives psychiatric care.\u201cI\u2019ve been out drinking, Monday to Friday to Sunday, and taking cocaine,\u201d he says of his life since May. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with it and the only thing that helps me is when I get drunk out of me mind.\u201dThe six-foot-nine boxer courted controversy long before this controversy courted him. He dressed as Batman during a press conference promoting his fight against Klitschko to call his mild-mannered opponent a joker. He later cited acceptance of homosexuality, pedophilia, and abortion as signs of the apocalypse, called mixed-martial arts a sport for white kids who can\u2019t box, and opined, \u201cI believe a woman\u2019s best place is in the kitchen and on her back.\u201dThe comments led to an uproar in Great Britain, particularly when the BBC considered him for an annual honor for sportsmen. The colorful personality, even though coupled with a dull style in the ring, brought attention back to the heavyweight division slumping stateside and elsewhere during the reign of the milquetoast Klitschko brothers.But his attention-grabbing reign may end relatively quickly either by his own decision or at the behest of boxing big-wigs eager to move on to a champion who fights contenders rather than demons.Fury announced his retirement earlier this week on Twitter. Then, three hours later, he announced his un-retirement.The heavyweight champion remains honest and defiant about his personal habits.\u201cListen, I\u2019ve done a lot of things in my life,\u201d he tells Rolling Stone. \u201cI\u2019ve done lots of cocaine. Lots of it. Why shouldn\u2019t I take cocaine? It\u2019s my life isn\u2019t it? I can do what I want.\u201cYeah, I have done cocaine. Plenty of people have done cocaine as well. What the fuck has that got to do with anything? That ain\u2019t a performance enhancing drug. Am I not allowed to have a life now as well?\u201dThe lineal heavyweight champ insists that discrimination, not drugs, motivates the attempts to take his titles.\u201cI feel more racism now in 2016 than any slave, any foreign immigrant ever did in the 1800s,\u201d Fury maintains. \u201cListen, when Muhammad Ali threw his gold medal away in the 1960s for being mistreated and abused, this is what I\u2019m doing today. I\u2019m throwing all my world titles in the bin because I ain\u2019t accepted in society for being a Traveler in 2016.\u201dBreitbart London, Breitbart Sports, Cocaine, Rolling Stone, Traveler, Tyson FuryComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Flynn4 Oct 20160Cromartie crouched down on a knee and raised a black-power fist for the playing of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d in London. Then he rose to his feet for \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201dBut his play during the game, rather than his antics before it, likely led to his release.The Colts lost the game to the longtime divisional doormat Jacksonville Jaguars 30-27. Jaguars QB Blake Bortles threw for 207 yards and two touchdowns. He ran for another score. Cromartie made four tackles at the Wembley Stadium matchup.\u201cThe four-time Pro Bowler struggled throughout and his play with the Colts was summed up by one series during their Week 4 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Mike Wells writes. \u201cCromartie was beaten twice and called for two penalties on a drive where the Jaguars managed to get a field goal as the first half came to an end. Cromartie was benched in favor of Rashaan Melvin in the second half.\u201dThe Colts rank 30th in points allowed, 24th in passing yards allowed, and 24th in team defense this young season. At 1-3, the team\u2019s generous defense accounts for their last-place standing in a weak division.Cromartie also took a knee for the anthem and raised his clenched fist (pictured above) before a win against the San Diego Chargers at Lucas Oil Stadium a week ago Sunday. That resulted in no repercussions, suggesting the aging corner\u2019s play rather than his political stance catalyzed his release.Cromartie signed a $3 million deal with the Colts prior to the season. He needed the money. Fathering a dozen children by eight different women, with twins arriving last year after a vasectomy, the prolific 32-year-old reportedly owes $336,000 annually in child support. He reportedly averted baby-mama drama, and the consequences of a Florida non-support warrant in the offseason, by signing with the Colts.Cromartie boasts 31 interceptions in eleven seasons with the Chargers, Jets, Cardinals, and Colts.

By Monday Dr. William Staub, director of Athletic Bands; Chris Ulffers, director of the School of Music; and Dr. Chris Buddo, dean of the College of Fine Arts and Communication, released an email warning the band not to try the stunt again.We regret the actions taken by 19 members of the East Carolina University Marching Pirates on game day October 1st felt hurtful to many in our Pirate family and disrespectful to our country. We understand and respect this is an issue where emotions are strong.The Marching Pirates continue to be fully supportive of all the values the East Carolina University community holds dear.We have met with the band and the members have collectively reaffirmed their commitment to the unique privilege and responsibility that comes with wearing the uniform of the Marching Pirates.College is about learning, and it is our expectation that the members of the Marching Pirates will learn from this experience and fulfill their responsibilities. While we affirm the right of all our students to express their opinions, protests of this nature by the Marching Pirates will not be tolerated moving forward.It is our hope that together we can move past these events and that the Marching Pirates will be part of the healing process, working as one Pirate Nation.Chancellor Staton also issued a separate statement, but one of a far more equivocal nature filled more with bromides than direct policy statements.As an institution of higher learning, East Carolina respects the rights of our students, staff and faculty to express their personal views. That is part of the free exchange of ideas on a university campus. While we acknowledge and understand the disappointment felt by many Pirate fans in response to the events at the beginning of today\u2019s football game, we urge all Pirate students, supporters and participants to act with respect for each other\u2019s views.Statement by #ECU chancellor Cecil Staton on the marching band members kneeling during the anthem. pic.twitter.com/KtZXvWtkSO\u2014 Michael Prunka (@MichaelPrunka) October 1, 2016According to Fox News, fans continued to boo the band during the halftime show, as well.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Colin Kaepernick, East Carolina UniversityComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

(AP) \u2014 With a large tear forming in his left eye, Jack Nicklaus asked everyone from the elite to the everyman to remember the time Arnold Palmer touched their lives during an emotional farewell to the King on Tuesday.\u201cI hurt like you hurt,\u201d Nicklaus said. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose a friend of 60 years and don\u2019t feel an enormous loss.\u201dThe service at Saint Vincent College in Palmer\u2019s hometown was filled with just as much laughter and warmth from stories of the most significant player in the modern game. The basilica at the college was packed with golf\u2019s biggest names from around the world.Charlie Mechem, the former LPGA commissioner who became one of Palmer\u2019s most trusted advisers, referred to them as the \u201celite battalion\u201d of Arnie\u2019s Army.Palmer died Sept. 25 in Pittsburgh as he was preparing for heart surgery. He was 87. His private funeral for family members was Thursday.\u201cWe were looking down at the air strip and the fog just suddenly lifted,\u201d Ernie Els said Tuesday after landing in one of several private jets that descended on Arnold Palmer Regional Airport. \u201cThis is a beautiful day. We\u2019ve all met different people in life. He was a man who didn\u2019t change. It didn\u2019t matter if you cut the grass or you were a president. He was the same with everybody.\u201dPalmer\u2019s co-pilot, Pete Luster, flew his plane around Saint Vincent College for nearly an hour before the service, tipping the left wing as he zoomed by.Mechem set a happy tone by pointing to a large photograph of Palmer with a grin that made everyone feel so important. He asked the crowd to remember the Palmer who hitched up his pants and gave a thumbs-up.\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that there are no irreplaceable people,\u201d Mechem said, his voice cracking toward the end of the ceremony. \u201cWhoever made that line didn\u2019t know Arnold Palmer. There will never be another.\u201dPalmer won 62 times on the PGA Tour, including seven major championships.The service was another reminder that Palmer was not the greatest golfer who ever lived, or even the best from his generation. He just had the greatest influence through television, through marketing and mostly through eye contact.PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem tried to explain Palmer\u2019s popularity by mentioning his attacking style of golf, his appeal on television and the way he carried himself.\u201cHe had this other thing,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cIt was the incredible ability to make you feel good \u2014 not just about him, but about yourself. I was amazed by how people reacted to him.

Once outside, though, Wood said a security guard told him he would have to agree never to bring the state flag with him to another Ole Miss game or run the risk of being arrested. When Wood asked if he would truly be arrested for carrying the state\u2019s flag, prompting the officer to spin him around and arrest him on the spot, taking him off to the local jail.Although Wood\u2019s flag was slightly larger than the permitted size, he said the flag issue has never been a problem in the past six years he has been attending Ole Miss football games.\u201cThis was never a problem until Ole Miss stopped playing \u2018Dixie,\u2019\u201d Woods told Breitbart Texas.The University of Mississippi announced back in August that it was bending to politically correct standards and would cease to play \u201cDixie,\u201d an iconic song for Ole Miss fans, in order to be more \u201cinclusive,\u201d Fox News reported at the time.Wood said the flag is being targeted by security at Ole Miss games, telling Breitbart Texas that other students had their stickers with the Mississippi state flag on them removed before entering the game.This is not the first time Ole Miss fans carrying Mississippi pride items have been asked to put their flags and banners away.Breitbart Texas reported last month how university security confiscated a number of flags and signs which read \u201cLet the band play \u2018Dixie.\u2019\u201dOne game attendee who had his sign and flag taken, Mike Espildora, took to his Instagram account, writing \u201cOle Miss did a great job displaying their pride and was wrongfully and violently shutdown, the fight isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d referring to the broader assault on the state flag by political correctness on college campuses.A spokesman with the Our State Flag Foundation told Breitbart Texas that it seemed security was specifically targeting Ole Miss fans who support the state flag.\u201cThe University officially says they are targeting because of the \u2018size of the banners, not because they are state flags\u2019,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThis is highly questionable though when you watch the videos, also because they allow big inflatable sharks, big foam fingers and retractable scroll signs sold in the stadium which are much larger than the Dixie and small state flags that were confiscated and targeted.\u201dMississippi State University and the\u00a0Mississippi University for Women have already removed the state flag from their campuses, as a politically correct-charged movement claims the banner promotes a racist ideology dating back to the Confederacy.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Our coaches do a great job of putting in a great game plan, and we just go out there and cover the guys up. Everybody on this defense wants to be great.\u201dThe Vikings (4-0) didn\u2019t record a sack after getting 13 over the past two games, but they were so tight in coverage and sound against the run that the Giants only converted 2 of 12 third downs. Second in the NFL with 12.5 points allowed per contest, the Vikings have conquered quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton and Manning in consecutive games \u2014 the last two league MVP award winners and a two-time Super Bowl champion. They\u2019re 6-2 against Manning in his career.Coach Mike Zimmer was concerned about Beckham, Victor Cruz and Sterling Shepard, as dangerous a trio of pass-catchers as there is in the NFL, so the Vikings didn\u2019t blitz the Giants (2-2) nearly as much as they did Rodgers\u2019 Packers or Newton\u2019s Panthers.\u201cIt just shows our versatility,\u201d linebacker Anthony Barr said.Sam Bradford threw a touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph for the third straight game and kept his turnover-free streak since joining the Vikings intact, and Matt Asiata and Jerick McKinnon each ran for a touchdown as part of a season-high 104 yards rushing for the team. Bradford was 26 of 36 for 262 yards passing, thriving with quick-release throws behind an offensive line that protected better than it had in any of the previous three games.Starting 4-0 for the first time since 2009, the Vikings joined Philadelphia and Denver as the league\u2019s only remaining undefeated teams.\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go. We\u2019re not handing out any medals tonight,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cThe attitude of this team, they like to work. It\u2019s good, and they actually tell me I\u2019m getting soft sometimes.\u201dReally?\u201cYeah, they do,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cThey tell me all the time, \u2018What are you doing? How come we\u2019re not in pads today?'\u201dHere are the top takeaways from the game:RHODES CLOSED: Beckham, who has yet to score this season during the longest touchdown-less streak of his three-year career, was smothered by cornerback Xavier Rhodes . Beckham wasn\u2019t nearly as agitated as he was the week before in his much-scrutinized matchup with Washington cornerback Josh Norman, but he picked up an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he and Rhodes bumped and jawed at each other out of bounds following a short catch in the second quarter.\u201cI\u2019ve just got to know it\u2019s all against me. It\u2019s going to be that way. I have to assume that I\u2019m always in the wrong no matter what,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThat\u2019s something, it\u2019s a tough pill to swallow, but you have to understand it. You have to be able to cope with it and just keep it moving.\u201dManning expressed more concern about his star receiver\u2019s behavior than he had before.\u201cHe\u2019s got to be aware,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for him, and he\u2019s got to play smart. We can\u2019t afford to do anything.\u201dKICKING CONUNDRUM: Blair Walsh missed his third field goal try in four games this season for the Vikings, this one a 46-yarder that never really had a chance. He has also missed two extra points this year, and Zimmer has sounded more and more like he\u2019s losing patience with his kicker.\u201cWe need to make those or it\u2019s going to bite us in the rear end,\u201d the coach said. \u201cOur team is playing close games. That\u2019s how we\u2019re built.\u201dWalsh did rebound to hit a 44-yarder not long after his miss, following an interception by Rhodes.QUICK PASSES: The Vikings led the NFL with 15 sacks in the first three games, and the Giants clearly preferred a quick-pass attack to neutralize the rush. Manning wasn\u2019t sacked, mostly preferring to dump the ball off on short routes to receivers on slants and backs in the flats. This is what the Vikings must expect now.\u201cYou look around the league, and there\u2019s franchise quarterbacks out there, man,\u201d Munnerlyn said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get those guys hurt. They\u2019re the money men. So you try to protect them and get rid of the ball real fast, and we just got to cover them up.\u201dSTRUGGLING SECONDARY: The Giants\u2019 secondary is depleted by injuries. Trevin Wade had trouble all game starting at cornerback for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Wade was beaten by Charles Johnson for receptions of 30 and 40 yards, had a pass interference penalty on Rudolph and got away with one on an early incompletion to Adam Thielen.RECIPE FOR TROUBLE: The Giants have a minus-8 turnover margin at the quarter mark of the season. After being penalized 11 times for 128 yards in a loss to Washington last week, they were flagged eight times for 69 yards in this game.___Online:AP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL coverage on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL___Follow Dave Campbell on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/DaveCampbellAPBreitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He told Breitbart Sports: \u201cThe U.S. has a fast-growing soccer fan base \u2014 so it\u2019s a chance for us to pick up new fans \u2014 it\u2019s always an attractive market for sponsors and in this day of nearly 24/7 digital content and social media the U.S. has passionate soccer followers that are very connected and consume a lot of sports content.\u201cWe see more and more opportunities for soccer in the U.S. \u2013 therefore we have been part of the Florida Cup for the past two years and will come back in January 2017.\u201dMr. Rotthaus uses\u00a0Chicharito as an example of how a player can drive a fan base in new territory and draw fans through the power of brand recognition.\u201cOf course, we know from our research and our conversations with experts in the U.S. that many consider Javier \u2018Chicharito\u2019 Hernandez to be among the top 2 or 3 most recognized soccer players in the U.S. as a result of the huge Mexican-American soccer fan base.\u201cHe attended this past year\u2019s Florida Cup in January and our Spanish language news platforms like Twitter exploded with followers this past year. We are also very proud of the fact that Bayer 04 has always been a leader in the Bundesliga for developing talent.\u201cThe fact that we had five players recently selected to the German national team mean that any time Bayer 04 is playing in the U.S. or abroad, fans get a glimpse of some of Germany\u2019s best \u2013 whether that\u2019s young defender Jonathan Tah, striker JulianBrandt or perhaps goalie Bernd Leno.\u201cOthers that might get noticed in the U.S. are Copa America champion Charles Aranguiz of Chile and Hakan Calhanoglu from Turkey, considered one of the best free kick specialists in the world. Since the the U.S. trip in January will be a more or less regular training camp in order to get prepared for the second half of the Bundesliga season, all of those players will be taking part.\u201dThe 2017 Florida Cup kicks off on January 7 with 14 teams from four federations with\u00a0the final on January 21. After that the club will continue to push itself onto the global stage with plans to grow and reach further onto the international scene, according to Mr Rotthaus.\u201cRight now, our focus is really to reach out to people, directly and digitally, in a professional and sustainable way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are \u00a0seeking to grow our fan base significantly and to tie the people to our brand consistently.

From Patrick Reed\u2019s emphatic takedown of European alpha dog Rory McIlroy to Phil Mickelson\u2019s sublime play that still only earned him a tie with Sergio Garcia, constant roars came from the American fans echoing throughout Hazeltine National Golf Club.The day got off to a rousing start as some yahoo in the crowd at the raucous first tee started a chant of \u201cAmerica! America!\u201d That yahoo turned out to be Bill Murray disguised in a floppy hat. Bill always seems to be having more fun than anyone else. I asked him if he\u2019d quickly read my screenplay and he got the joke. Murray and I walked in the first group with Reed and McIlroy and saw possibly the greatest eight holes of match play golf ever played.On the eighth green after both players were four under McIlroy drained a 60-foot bomb that set off a full-throated celebration that included his hand to his ear telling the American hecklers, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d Not to be outdone Reed dropped a 30-footer from the fringe right on top of McIlroy\u2019s ball. That was punctuated with another scream and a Mutomboesque finger wag at McIlroy as if to say not in my house. It was an exchange in the genteel sport of golf you\u2019re never likely to see again. And since it was golf, both players fist bumped to show there was no ill will.After seven birdies and an eagle over four holes, they both came back to earth. After that exchange Reed built a one up lead going into the 18th hole. Both hit titanic drives and pinpoint approach shots. Reed was first to putt and had a slippery seven foot downhiller to win the match. He drained it as everyone expected. As he celebrated madly, McIlroy, who never had the chance to sink his birdie, calmly shook hands with everyone involved before walking off the green and launching his putter at his golf bag. He had played well but came up just short against American golf\u2019s John Wayne.A little further back on the course was the other epic match of the day between old Ryder Cup foes Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia. They combined to shoot 19 birdies over 18 holes. While McIlroy and Reed started out as the best match play contest ever, this contest was great throughout. They came to the par three 17th hole, all knotted up. Both hit excellent tee shots and sank their putts for birdie. That left the 18th hole to decide this crucial match.Phil said earlier in the week that,\u201d this is the most pressure I\u2019ve ever been under.\u201d That is a familiar refrain from Ryder Cup players, even ones as accomplished as Phil who owns five majors and has seen it all on a golf course. Sergio, who many consider to be the best player without a major (as he was reminded constantly by the heckling crowd at Hazeltine), also had to deal with the pressure of securing a much-needed point for Europe.Clutch play was the order of the day though, and they both crushed tee shots down the middle. Phil hit a beautiful nine iron that flew right over the flag and landed and stopped 15 feet above the hole. Not to be outdone, Sergio knocked his approach eight feet from the pin, flag high. Two amazing shots under incredible pressure. You really have to hand it to the both of them. As Phil lined up his putt and under normal circumstances it was a putt a professional would make about 20% of the time. This was Phil in a big moment, though, and he drained it as expected. His celebration was a sight to behold as he tried to duplicate his jump into the air made famous when he won the Masters in 2004. Sergio still had his putt to tie.This is a moment when most golfers would wilt and leave a putt short or hit it offline but Sergio calmly holed it and gave an understated fist bump. Both teams received a half point and for the Americans it was becoming clear that they were on their way to gaining back the Ryder Cup. After Rickie Fowler edged out Justin Rose on the 18th hole the wait was on to see who would secure the winning point. It was final captain\u2019s pick Ryan Moore and he left the ball in the hole for captain Davis Love to retrieve and keep as a reminder of a team that brought the Ryder Cup back to its rightful owner.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Patriots, who moved into Gillette Stadium in 2002, were last blanked at home 6-0 by the New York Jets in 1993 at Foxboro Stadium.Tyrod Taylor connected with LeSean McCoy for a 7-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter, Dan Carpenter added three field goals for Buffalo (2-2).It was Buffalo\u2019s second win in its last 16 visits to Foxborough. Including his tenure with the New York Jets, it gave Bills coach Rex Ryan his first regular-season road victory over Bill Belichick in eight tries. The last Bills\u2019 shutout win away From Orchard Park was 23-0 over Washington in a Buffalo \u201chome\u201d game at Toronto on Oct. 30, 2011.After struggling to maintain drives and finding a run-pass balance, Taylor was spot-on Sunday. He finished 27 for 39 for 246 yards, and directed a unit that was 7 for 15 on third downs. The Bills had been 10 of 36 combined in the first three games.Buffalo\u2019s defense also carried over its dominant effort from its 33-18 win over Arizona, sacking rookie Jacoby Brissett three times.Brissett made his second consecutive start in place of Jimmy Garoppolo (sore right shoulder). But Brissett, playing a week after injuring his right thumb, struggled to find the command he had in leading the Patriots to a 27-0 win over the Texans. New England finished 1 for 12 on third downs and managed just 277 total yards.After managing to reach the red zone with four drives in their first three games, the Bills did it on their first two series Sunday.Their first possession, a 12-play, 65-yard drive, ended in Taylor\u2019s touchdown strike to McCoy. The second stretched 52 yards over 10 plays and was capped by the first of two first-half field goals by Dan Carpenter.PREGAME SCUFFLE: Several punches were thrown when a shoving match erupted near the sideline about an hour before kickoff. The altercation appeared to begin when Brissett was jogging along the field and was shoved by Bills safety Robert Blanton. Brissett didn\u2019t stop, and New England rookie receiver Malcolm Mitchell retaliated by shoving Blanton. Blanton responded by punching Mitchell in the chest and head-butting him, which led to several other players and assistant coaches getting involved. Later, Bills safety Aaron Williams shoved a Patriots assistant coach attempting to separate the players. As the scuffles began to dissipate, Buffalo cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman landed a punch on Blanton\u2019s facemask.FIRST DOWN EFFICIENCY: The Bills matched a season high for first downs with 16 in the first half alone. Buffalo had 16 in each of its past two games after opening the season with 11 in a 13-7 loss at Baltimore. Taylor opened by hitting 14 of his first 17 attempts for 138 yards and a touchdown before closing the half 17 of 22 for 165 yards. That topped the 119 yards passing he had in last week\u2019s 33-18 win over Arizona.SLOW GOING: The Patriots\u2019 offense was anemic in the opening quarter, failing to get a first down while managing 20 total yards. It was the first time the Patriots went without a first-quarter first down since Week 8 of 2011 against Pittsburgh.FIRST CATCH: TE Rob Gronkowski, who played sparingly in his season debut last week, caught his first pass of the season, an 11-yard reception in the fourth quarter.INJURIES: Patriots TE Martellus Bennett limped off the field and Patriots DT Vincent Valentine left in the third quarter with a back injury. Bills CB Corey White was escorted to the locker room in the fourth quarter and placed in the concussion protocol after being shaken up while covering punt.___AP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFLBreitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Maybe he can pull them aside and get the re-training under way.As for this Sunday\u2019s games, the Jets-Seahawks might be the best contest on the slate. Let\u2019s preview the action\u2026Seattle Seahawks (2-1) at New York Jets (1-2)Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis called this a \u201cmust-win\u201d game for his team.The talented Seahawks coming to town makes for a far from ideal \u201cmust-win\u201d game.If Seattle QB Russell Wilson were healthy, this game might be an easy win for Seattle. But the usually mobile quarterback plays with two serious leg injuries, a high-ankle sprain and an MCL knee ailment. On top of this, his offensive line isn\u2019t very good, and the Jets\u2019 defensive line is one of the best in football.So this game is a toss-up.Buffalo Bills (1-2) at New England Patriots (3-0)The New England Patriots have a chance to go 4-0 during Tom Brady\u2019s suspension with a win over Buffalo. Who\u2019d a thunk it?The Bills put star receiver Sammy Watkins on injured reserve, and key backup wideout Greg Salas is out, so Buffalo is short weaponry.The Patriots last played on Thursday Night Football, so Bill Belichick had 10 days to prepare. He\u2019s usually lethal with extra time in the war room.If Patriots #2 QB Jimmy Garrappolo (shoulder sprain) plays, New England should win. If he doesn\u2019t, this game could go either way.Carolina Panthers (1-2) at Atlanta Falcons (2-1)The Panthers are probably happy to get out of Charlotte for a couple of days. Recently, there\u2019s been rioting and looting there, and they train and play very close to the impacted area. Last week in a home loss to Minnesota, they seemed distracted. Case in point \u2014 QB Cam Newton didn\u2019t throw a single pass to wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, a transcendent talent. Don\u2019t expect that to happen again.Atlanta is coming off a win at New Orleans, but it\u2019s hard to judge them by that game because the Saints had myriad starters out.This game is a toss-up.Cleveland Browns (0-3) at Washington Redskins (1-2)The Cleveland Browns are dysfunctional mess.This past week, wide receiver Josh Gordon entered rehab again, and cops arrested guard Alvin Bailey for failure to comply, drug abuse, drug paraphernalia, and operating an unsafe vehicle.On top of all that, they are really beat up, with several players out, including starting receiver Corey Coleman and defensive end Carl Nassib.The Redskins should win this game, especially at home.Indianapolis Colts (1-2) at Jacksonville Jaguars (0-3)By the time you see this, this game might be over; it\u2019s being played in London at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.If the Jaguars lose and slip to 0-4, coach Gus Bradley could be looking for work this week.Dallas Cowboys (2-1) at San Francisco 49ers (1-2)49ers backup quarterback-activist Colin Kapernick outdid himself following Monday night\u2019s presidential debate.Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Kaepernick said on Tuesday, \u201cLet\u2019s make America great again for the first time.\u201dKeapernick should read a book about D-Day.Dallas might be without the left side of the offensive line due to injuries, and San Francisco has a talented defensive line.This game could go either way.Denver Broncos (3-0) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-2)Bucs coach Dirk Koetter thinks his team needs a culture change after a 1-2 start and five straight losing seasons.\u201cWe\u2019re just missing something, I feel like, and as my title suggests, it\u2019s my job to speak up,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cI feel like sometimes we find too many ways to lose a game instead of creating ways to win a game. Now, when I say that, I put myself right at the top. I\u2019m No. 1 on that list. So I\u2019m not calling out any player or any coach above myself, but that\u2019s just how I feel.\u201dBeating the defending Super Bowl champions would be a good way to start a culture change.Detroit Lions (1-2) and Chicago Bears (0-3)Yawn.Two beat-up teams heading in the wrong direction.The Lions are ravaged, with both starting defensive ends and three linebackers hurt.The Bears signed long-time Lions running back Joique Bell this week, so he likely provided them great intel on Detroit\u2019s playbook.It\u2019s not out of the realm that the Bears find a way to win this game.Los Angeles Rams (2-1) at Arizona Cardinals (1-2)The Cardinals gave up 208-yards rushing last week in Buffalo.They better get their act together with talented Rams tailback Todd Gurley coming to the desert.The Rams should be a formidable opponent, but expect Arizona to find a way to win at home.New Orleans Saints (0-3) at San Diego Chargers (1-2)Both these teams have so many injuries, this is tough game to call.The Chargers might be without 3/5th of their offensive line and star tight end Antonio Gates. Their injured reserve list is a who\u2019s who of key players.Don\u2019t be surprised if the Saints get their first win. QB Drew Brees is highly-motivated against the team that dumped him for Philip Rivers.Oakland Raiders (2-1) at Baltimore Ravens (3-0)The Ravens get star pass rusher Elvis Dumervil back from a foot injury, and the Raiders might be playing their third-string right tackle, with Menelik Watson and Austin Howard out.Oakland is much-improved this year, but winning in Baltimore with offensive line problems in a noisy stadium might not be in the cards.Tennessee Titans (1-2) and Houston Texans (2-1)With the Texans\u2019 offense stagnant, head coach Bill O\u2019Brien will take over the play calling.Houston will need more from their offense, with star defensive end J.J. Watt out for the year after re-injuring his back.The Texans should find a way to win at home.Kansas City Chiefs (2-1) at Pittsburgh Steelers (2-1)The Chiefs played the last two games without both starting guards. They get them back this week, along with star tailback Jamaal Charles, who hasn\u2019t played since last November due to a knee injury.The Steelers are coming off an embarrassing blow-out loss last week in Philadelphia, but list seven players \u201cout\u201d on their injury report, including key starters, guard Ramon Foster and linebacker Ryan Shazier.These two teams look very evenly-matched, and this game could go either way.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

From his introduction Friday on the first tee where a few spectators yelled out \u201cRory is short\u201d to a psychotic fan running up to him Saturday between the seventh and eighth green and yelling, \u201cSuck a d***, Rory!\u201dWhatever happened to Minnesota nice?This type of fan behavior needs to be policed. And not by the authorities but by other fans nearby.In a healthy society, the fan yelling that to a nice guy like McIlroy would have had his ears boxed, his eye blackened, and been sent on his way in shame and humiliation. Does nobody box ears anymore? This is golf\u2019s version of broken windows policing. Since idiotic golf fans have been getting away with shouting out \u201cbababooey\u201d and \u201cmashed potato\u201d after every tee shot, we now have some madman who thinks he can scream \u201csuck a d***\u201d into the face of the best golfer in the world. That\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works. American golf fans need to, dare I say, make golf great again and refuse to stand idly by while idiots, drunk or not, lambaste living icons with their uncreative invective.When the Irishman was asked how to describe the crowd, he took the high road. \u201cI\u2019d say most of all tough,\u201d he said of the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment for us to come and play in. We expect that. It\u2019s the same for the U.S. guys when they come to play in Europe.\u201dThat was definitely diplomatic but not truthful. The Euro crowds have never behaved as poorly as we are seeing at Hazeltine. We have whole galleries cheering when a European player hits a ball into the water? That goes against everything that golf is about.The beauty of being a golf fan is you can root for every player. And this is not a one-off type of thing. Crowds are boisterously cheering missed putts on every hole. At least let Arnold Palmer settle in before he starts rolling over in his grave.Jack Nicklaus perhaps anticipated such fan behavior when he called for sportsmanship and manners befitting of a gentleman\u2019s game at the opening ceremonies. With the alcohol factor, more of the incidents are happening later in the day. But more so than boozers, the fans are boorish. If they think they can get away with it, then they will continue to do it. If they can ignore counsel from an elder statesman of Nicklaus\u2019s stature, it\u2019s probably time for some adults in the crowd to start enforcing etiquette.The actual golf on the course has been tremendous. Rory has been the dominant player for Europe winning three points thus far and Patrick Reed has been the stalwart for America with two-and-a-half points. They happen to be paired together to do battle in Sunday singles. They will tee off first in what promises to be an epic showdown.The U.S. leads Europe 9.5 to 6.5 and is well positioned to win their first Ryder Cup since 2008.Breitbart Sports, Jack Nicklaus, Rory McIlroy, Ryder CupComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

On the same day, the NL Central winning Chicago Cubs will host the wild card game winner.The Baltimore Orioles\u2019 bid to seal a playoff berth was thwarted by the Yankees in New York, where Austin Romine produced a two-run double with one out in the bottom of the eighth inning as the hosts rallied for a 7-3 victory.The Orioles started the day with a one-game lead over Toronto for the first American League wild card spot, and after the defeat the Blue Jays, Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners remained in the hunt for the last two AL places.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

On April 28,\u00a0The Post Game\u00a0asked Wentz what he likes to do off the field. He said:Hunting is big. I fish a little bit, but I\u2019m more into the hunting world. I fell in love with it when I was in college. It\u2019s a release from football to get away. In college, it\u2019s football all the time. Going forward, it\u2019s going to be football, football, football. Hunting is a good release, good way to get away from the game and just decompress, even it\u2019s just for a couple hours. I\u2019ve always enjoyed it. I\u2019ve got a 3-year-old golden retriever that I\u2019ve raised. She hunts with me too. She loves it. Always makes it more enjoyable.When they asked him what roll the dog plays in his hunting excursions, Wentz said: \u201cWhen we\u2019re bird hunting, so duck and goose hunting and also pheasants, she\u2019ll fetch the birds and swim after the birds in the hunting water. She loves it. When I wake up at 3:30, 4 in the morning, she knows what\u2019s going on. She sees me grab the gun, she\u2019s ready to go, she\u2019s fired up. She might even love it more than I do.\u201dThe Associated Press reports that Wentz was named the NFL\u2019s Rookie of the Month for September.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

The massive Mancunian\u2019s handlers initially claimed that mental health issues, rather than any physical ailment, sidetracked Fury from defending his title. The excuse now appears somewhat suspect knowing that Fury\u2019s camp received notification of the failed drug test prior to offering the mental-health issues excuse.\u201cThis letter is to advise you that the \u2018A\u2019 sample urine specimen number 4006253 collected from Tyson Fury on September 22, 2016 in Lancaster, England through his participation in the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) program has been analyzed for anabolic agents, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, stimulants and drugs of abuse,\u201d read a letter sent to Fury by VADA president Dr. Margaret Goodman that ESPN obtained. \u201cThe results of the analysis are as follows: Adverse. Urine specimen contains benzoylecgonine.\u201dAlthough benzoylecgonine remains in the system longer than cocaine, its presence generally does not stick around for more than a week or two. People who test positive for it, then, generally used the drug in close proximity to the test, which could indicate a habitual user or someone too undisciplined to refrain despite knowledge of a pending test.After shocking Wladimir Klitschko with his upset win last November, Fury shocked the Fourth Estate by stating in a free-ranging interview that \u201ca woman\u2019s best place is in the kitchen and on her back,\u201d calling mixed-martial arts \u201cfor white kids who can\u2019t box,\u201d and saying that the legalization of abortion, homosexuality, and pedophilia signals the apocalypse. He showed up to a press conference promoting his rematch with Klitschko fat and out of shape. The comments, the cocaine, and the corpulence lead critics to call on the WBA and WBO to strip him of his belts.Breitbart London, Breitbart Sports, Cocaine, Tyson FuryComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Let\u2019s harken back to 2006, January of 2007. In January 2017, Nick Saban left the Miami Dolphins as its head coach with three years left on his contract to take over Alabama. Less than a month earlier in December of 2006, Nick Saban looked at the media and said, \u2018I guess I have to say this. I will not be the coach at Alabama.\u2019 So essentially he lied, or he changed his mind. Whatever the case may be, he had three years left on his contract following a 6-10 season in Miami and left that contract. It speaks to what my problem is with the collegiate ranks.

Flynn30 Sep 20160Of the 20 Rio Olympians and Paralympians that the president recognized by name on Thursday, 16 were female. Michael Phelps alone among the men who won gold at Rio heard his name called by the commander in chief. At one point, he read off descriptions of the feats of 12 Olympians \u2014 all of them women. In this list, he mentioned the sports that these 12 women competed in save for Kim Rhode, whom he calls a \u201cfemale Olympian\u201d who \u201cmedaled at six straight Games.\u201d Medaled in what? Shooting.\u201cYou will notice that there was a preponderance of women that I was mentioning here,\u201d he explained regarding a list entirely comprised of women. \u201cOne of the reasons our country is so proud of this year\u2019s Team USA is 2016 belonged to America\u2019s women Olympians, I mean, no question. We had more women competing in these Games than any nation ever. Our women alone won more golds than most countries did. Our women\u2019s 61 medals \u2014 most ever by any women\u2019s team \u2014 breaking the record set by, of course, Team USA four years ago.\u201dDespite the president\u2019s claim that \u201c2016 belonged to America\u2019s women Olympians,\u201d the American men and women won almost the same number of medals with the males claiming 55, the ladies taking home 61, and mixed teams grabbing five. America\u2019s team in Rio consisted of 291 women and 263 men.\u201cAnd then there are some firsts that show the world America\u2019s greatness doesn\u2019t come only from high scores or fast times, but from our diversity and our tolerance and our open hearts,\u201d the president announced of a bronze medalist at this year\u2019s games. \u201cThis summer\u2019s fencer, Ibtihaj Muhammad, became the first American female athlete to compete in the Olympic Games in a hijab. And that\u2019s important too, because one of the wonderful things we love when we see our Olympians is everybody is from all kinds of different backgrounds and shapes and sizes \u2014 although all very good-looking.\u201dPresident Obama maintained that the essential ingredients to sending such a successful delegation of athletes to Rio included gay rights and open borders. He explained:There\u2019s no kid in America who can\u2019t look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere. That\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re successful \u2014 because we gather talent from every corner of the globe. And through the years of people arriving \u2014 whether it\u2019s in Ellis Island or Angel Island or coming over the Rio Grande; some cases, coming not of their own accord \u2014 we\u2019ve become something more than just the sum of our parts. We\u2019ve become Americans together. And there\u2019s something special about that \u2014 all races, all faiths, all traditions, all orientations, all marching together under that same proud flag. Not bound by a creed or a color, but by our devotion to an enduring set of ideals: That we\u2019re all created equal, that we can think and worship and love as we please, and that we can pursue our own version of happiness.The president also recognized two past Olympians, runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who gained fame for raising black-gloved fists during the national anthem at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Obama characterized the two track stars as symbols of unity. The president, who invited the pair to the event, held: \u201cTheir powerful silent protest in the 1968 Games was controversial, but it woke folks up and created greater opportunity for those that followed.\u201dIn one part of the event devoid of politicization, gymnast Simone Biles presented the president with a surf board signed by the Olympians attending the White House event. The Hawaii-born Obama noted that next year offers him much time to surf.Big Government, Breitbart Sports, Obama, barack obama, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Simone BilesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

American captain Davis Love seemed either really nervous or overcome with emotion because his voice gave out a few times. The pairings for Friday morning were what everyone was waiting for. They are listed below with analysis and predictions.Morning Foursomes (aka alternate shot)Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed vs. Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose:\u00a0 A monster matchup to start it off.\u00a0 Spieth and Reed were a formidable duo in Gleneagles in 2014 and Rose and Stenson were the Olympic gold and silver medal winners in Rio. This will be a lot of fun to watch, especially on the first tee when the crowd will be going absolutely bonkers. Pick\u2014Spieth/Reed with the American crowd putting them over the top.Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler vs. Rory McIlroy and Andy Sullivan: Rory, coming off his thrilling Fed-Ex Cup victory, will carry Ryder Cup rookie Sullivan to victory. Mickelson and Fowler, while a popular duo, haven\u2019t been playing well. Pick\u2014McIlroy/Sullivan.Jimmy Walker and Zach Johnson vs. Sergio Garcia and Martin Kaymer: Strange pick here by Davis Love as Walker and Johnson are not known as great ball strikers. Pick\u2014Ryder Cup studs Garcia and Kaymer handily.Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar vs. Lee Westwood and Thomas Pieters: DJ is back after missing the 2014 Ryder Cup due to a suspension from the PGA Tour. Kuchar is always solid in Ryder Cups. Westwood, while a Ryder Cup stalwart, plays well past his prime and probably shouldn\u2019t have been picked. Pieters is a wide-eyed Ryder Cup rookie who looked a tad overwhelmed at the opening ceremony.

The number 16 jersey that he wore for the school\u2019s varsity baseball team hung on a hanger in the dugout for all to view. According to Alonzo Raven\u2019s head baseball coach Landy Faedo, after everyone had left the memorial he noticed the empty coat hanger hanging on the dugout fence.\u201cIt boggles my mind that someone would do something like that, especially when we\u2019re doing something nice for Jose and thinking about him and knowing that he\u2019s not going to be with us anymore,\u201d coach Faedo lamented.Fernandez tragically\u00a0 lost his life in a boating accident on Sunday morning when he and two of his friends crashed into a Miami jetty traveling at a high speed. The Marlins drafted the right-handed power pitcher right out of high school as the 14th overall pick in the 2011\u00a0MLB draft. The Cuban immigrant became the first player in the school\u2019s history to make it to Major League Baseball.\u00a0The Tampa Bay Times reported that Alonso High Principal Kenneth Hart doesn\u2019t believe that a current student or alumni would steal the jersey. He has broadcast the incident on social media and to everyone in the school, asking that anyone with information or clues relating to who may have taken the jersey to please come forward.\u201cI would take money right out of my pocket to get it back,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting, the lowest of the low.\u201dBreitbart Sports, Jose FernandezComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Since then, Duterte has established a bounty for civilians who personally detain or kill drug offenders and promised police who kill drug suspects absolution should they be charged with homicide.International human rights observers have expressed concern with Duterte\u2019s shoot-first-ask-questions-later approach. In response, Duterte has called both Pope Francis and President Barack Obama \u201cson of a whore;\u201d threatened to \u201cwhack\u201d UN observers \u201cin the head;\u201d and responded to EU concerns with \u201cf\u2014 you.\u201dPacquiao, who did not endorse Duterte\u2019s campaign but has now become a key ally of the president\u2019s in the Senate, says his attitude is necessary for a nation that has forgotten the fundamentals of respect.\u00a0\u201cGod put him there for a reason, for purpose \u2014 to discipline the people,\u201d he argued.\u00a0\u201cIn the\u00a0past administrations, people didn\u2019t respect the law, the leader, the authorities\u2026. What Duterte is trying to do is let the people know \u2014 and put it in their hearts and minds \u2014 that you need to respect the law of the land.\u201dPacquiao referred to Duterte as a \u201crespectful person, a hospitable person, a friendly person\u201d and \u201ca very nice guy.\u201d The two are from the Philippine island of Mindanao, where Duterte served as mayor of Davao City for 22 years, and have a lengthy friendship.\u00a0\u201cHe helped me a lot. He helped me with the promotion when I started in boxing. One of my fights held in Davao, he sponsored it,\u201d Pacquiao told Reuters.That friendship has its limits, however. Pacquiao tells Reuters that Duterte did not know that, as a young man, he had tried \u201call kinds of drugs.\u201d He did not believe that this would affect their relationship, though, because Duterte \u201calways gives a chance to people who want to be changed.\u201dDuterte, while presiding over an anti-drug campaign that he has himself referred to as \u201cbloody,\u201d has repeatedly asserted that his government will provide rehabilitation services for any drug-addicted person who surrenders to police. As part of his campaign against drugs, he is working to fundraise to build more rehabilitation services, even suggesting converting a newly-discovered methamphetamine lab into a rehabilitation facility.Pacquiao served a six-year term in the Philippine Congress before winning election to the Senate in June. He promised to retire from boxing at the time to be able to handle a full-time Senate appointment. But he faces Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas in November.While Pacquiao has admitted to a lascivious lifestyle in the past, he became a born-again Christian in 2012, and has since been an outspoken supporter of Christian beliefs in the predominantly Catholic nation. His faith attracted negative attention when he compared LGBT individuals to \u201canimals,\u201d a statement he later apologized for, and has made him the target of radical Islamic groups on the island of Mindanao.Breitbart Sports, National Security, barack obama, boxing, Drug War, Drugs, God, Manny Pacquiao, Philippines, Rodrigo DuterteComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Jenkins, penned an editorial for The Wall Street Journal wherein he said the NCAA has overstepped its authority with its attempt to\u00a0impose moral ideals on college sports.In particular, the priest is concerned over the NCAA\u2019s action of moving 2016-17 national championship games away from North Carolina because of the state\u2019s HB2 bathroom law. Jenkins essentially asserted that the sports organization has no right to involve itself in legislation passed by state governments. He also hinted that the NCAA has gotten arrogant because of the huge amount of money college sports generates.\u201cThe role of such associations,\u201d Jenkins said of the NCAA, \u201cis to foster athletic competition that is fair and serves the well-being of student-athletes. There is plenty of work for them to do in that sphere without assuming the role of spokesperson for their members on contentious political and social issues.\u201dJenkins allowed that \u201crespect\u201d for the LGBT community is important, but so are the positions of those who feel threatened by men pretending to be women in public restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms.Heightened respect for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens is a signal moral achievement of our time, and harboring reservations about any retrenchment is natural. Yet some citizens may wonder about the implications of substituting gender identity for biological sex in public restrooms. While attending to the rights and sensibilities of transgender persons, it\u2019s important to also take into account the feelings of those who might be uncomfortable undressing in front of a member of the opposite biological sex.Jenkins closed with a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the failure of many institutions of higher learning.At a time when tweets, slogans and sound bites seem to define the substance of our political discourse; when respect for truth seems a casualty of the campaign; and when ideological polarization often hamstrings responsible governing, the nation needs universities to raise the intellectual tone of Americans\u2019 discussions more than ever. We must strive to do a better job of providing this service. We will certainly fail if we delegate the work to athletic associations.The conflict between the NCAA and the state of North Carolina arose when the state legislature passed HB2 into law to protect the safety of women and children from predators who may pretend to be women in order to gain access to\u00a0the women\u2019s facilities in public places.The bill, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory said, was heavily opposed by the deep pockets of gay advocacy organizations from outside the state.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Bathroom Bill, HB2, NCAA, Notre DameComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

QB Trevor Knight (TAMU)\u2014His completion percentage is abysmal, but it is undeniable that the Aggie quarterback has elevated this team at a time when many were concerned about the direction of the program.9. RB Dalvin Cook (Florida State)\u2014The Seminole running back finally got going against South Florida, but he has a long way to go to become a serious threat.8. QB Seth Russell (Baylor)\u2014Last season, Russell sat pretty high on our list until he got hurt. Looking ahead this year, the Baylor signal caller is starting to put up big stats and could have his team positioned to run the table in the lackluster Big 12.7. LB Jabrill Peppers (Michigan)\u2014It\u2019s not often that a linebacker returns punts, but Jabrill Peppers is no ordinary player. He averages 22.7 yards per punt return and boasts 33 tackles, 9.5 TFLs, and two sacks through four games this season. This Wolverine is special.6. QB Deshaun Watson (Clemson)\u2014This is not the position many thought Watson would be in at this stage, but a big game and a win against Louisville could allow him to really make a move.5. RB Donnell Pumphrey (San Diego State)\u2014Pumphrey averages just shy of 200 yards per game and rushes for 8.2 yards per carry. Not many have taken the time to watch him play, but chatter could increase for the Aztec as the stats pile up and the wins come in for his team.4. QB Greg Ward (Houston)\u2014The problem for Ward will be his schedule. There are no marquee matchups for Houston until they face off against Louisville. His team must keep winning, and his stats need to improve in order for him to be in the thick of the conversation.3. QB JT Barrett (Ohio State)\u2014For Barrett to make a run, he will need to charge late. Still, after a bye week, he needs to build the stat resume against Rutgers and Indiana these next two weeks.2. RB Christian McCaffrey (Stanford)\u2014The man who should have won it last year is currently taking a back seat to a signal caller whose production could reach historic levels. Don\u2019t count out McCaffrey yet, though.1. QB Lamar Jackson (Louisville)\u2014It is really early in the season, but a strong performance and a win against Clemson would mean Jackson would need a significant drop off in play in order to lose the Heisman.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Monday\u2019s game between the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints received a low 5.7 rating, a 38 percent plunge from\u00a0week three of last year.Notably, the game was competing against\u00a0the first presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, an event that\u00a0earned\u00a0the biggest debate audience in U.S. political history. According to CNN Money, the September 26 debate brought in more than\u00a080 million viewers.But the NFL has also been suffering under the anti-American protests during the playing of the national anthem, which San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick started three weeks ago.Since Kaepernick decided to sit out the anthem instead of standing\u00a0at attention as everyone else was doing, a host of other players across the NFL have joined him in his attack on the United States.Some have decided to emulate Kaepernick\u2019s action of staying seated during the anthem. Others took up his secondary protest of kneeling in the field during the song. Still others have taken to raising the militant black power fist in the air during the anthem.Not content with his on-field protests, Kaepernick has continued his anti-American rants off the field. Recently, as a rejoinder to GOP nominee Donald Trump,\u00a0he said the United States was never great.\u201cHe always says, \u2018Make America great again,'\u201d Kaepernick said of Trump. \u201cWell, America has never been great for people of color and that\u2019s something that needs to be addressed. Let\u2019s make America great for the first time.\u201dSince his first attempt to criticize the country, Kaepernick\u2019s anti-American protest has spread to other sports, including high school and college athletics.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Big Government, Breitbart Sports, Pre-Viral, Colin Kaepernick, National Anthem, NFL, protests, ratingsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Boise State 3-0 [Defeated UNLV, Last Week NR]\u2014Like Donnell Pumphrey, Jeremy McNichols is making a name for himself on a team that could go undefeated.23. TCU 3-1 [Defeated SMU, Last Week NR]\u2014At this point, the Horned Frogs are still very much a contender in the Big 12, but they need to beat Oklahoma to build momentum.22.

Oklahoma 1-2 [Bye, Last Week NR]\u2014Yes, the Sooners have a losing record, but this is a talented team. A loss against TCU could send things on a downward spiral fast, though.20. Arizona State 4-0 [Defeated Cal, Last Week #24]\u2014The Sun Devils won a shootout over Cal and could make a run in the PAC 12.19. San Diego State 3-0 [Bye, Last Week #19]\u2014SDSU visits a South Alabama team that beat Mississippi State but has been atrocious since then.18. Florida 3-1 [Lost to Tennessee, Last Week #15]\u2014All streaks come to an end, but Florida\u2019s collapse against UT has to sting. The rest of the schedule lines up well for them to stay in SEC East contention, though.17. Utah 4-0 [Defeated USC, Last Week NR]\u2014The Utes avoid Stanford and could make a run, but a game at Cal may be tougher than expected.16. Nebraska 4-0 [Defeated Northwestern, Last Week #21]\u2014I\u2019m not sure how good the Cornhuskers are, but they aren\u2019t helped by their three challenging games (Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Iowa) all occuring on the road.15.

Baylor 4-0 [Defeated Oklahoma State, Last Week #18]\u2014The Big 12 is laughably bad, but we could find ourselves in a situation where there is an intense debate at the end of the season over whether the Bears deserve to be in the playoff should they stay undefeated. They are the conference\u2019s only hope.13. Florida State 3-1 [Defeated USF, Last Week #14]\u2014It was not a close game against USF, but I would have liked to see more from the Seminoles following such an embarrassing defeat.12.

We find out this week against Stanford.9. Wisconsin 4-0 [Defeated Michigan State, Last Week #11]\u2014Our first change in the rankings earned a bump with a route of Michigan State. If the Badgers get past Michigan, playoff buzz could begin though there would still be a merciless three game stretch ahead.8. Texas A&M 4-0 [Defeated Arkansas, Last Week #8]\u2014Trevor Knight has come up huge for the Aggies, which now are the last real threat to Alabama in the SEC West.7. Stanford 3-0 [Defeated USC, Last Week #7]\u2014After defeating the two LA teams, McCaffrey and the Cardinal could emerge as the clear favorite in the PAC 12 with a win at Washington on Friday.6. Michigan 4-0 [Defeated Penn State, Last Week #6]\u2014The Wolverines are rolling, but will they fall victim to a Badgers team that has already taken out two top ten opponents? Smart money says no, but watch out.5. Clemson 4-0 [Defeated Georgia Tech, Last Week #5]\u2014Dabo\u2019s team has started slow, but all will be forgiven if they can beat Jackson and the Cardinals.4. Houston 4-0 [Defeated Texas State, Last Week #4]\u2014The Cougars dominated Texas State, but they have to be concerned about a series of games that may make them forgettable until they face off against Louisville in November.3. Ohio State 3-0 [Bye, Last Week #3]\u2014I\u2019m not sure OSU needed a bye week ahead of Rutgers and Indiana, but circle the October 15 game at Wisconsin. That game looks a lot tougher than expected at the beginning of the season.2. Louisville 4-0 [Defeated Marshall, Last Week #2]\u2014One of the biggest matchups of the season will feature this week\u2019s contest at Clemson. Who would have thought that the main question going into this game would be \u201cCan the Tigers stop Lamar Jackson?\u201d and not \u201cCan the Cardinals stop Deshaun Watson?\u201d1. Alabama 4-0 [Defeated Kent State, Last Week: #1]\u2014The Golden Flashes couldn\u2019t do anything against the Tide who got banged up a bit.

He won the Rookie of the Year award in 2013 for the Miami Marlins, which changed its name shortly after drafting him, and enjoyed one of the highest strikeout ratios in baseball, two All-Star nods, and a tremendous home record that witnessed his first loss at Marlins Park in dozens of career starts earlier this season.Breitbart Sports, Jose FernandezComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The England role has become comical,\u201d Ferdinand said.\u201cThis was a man who was passionate about getting the job. He forced the FA to act.\u201cNaivety seems to be the word coming up. It\u2019s disappointing for English football.\u201dAllardyce had been appointed to replace Roy Hodgson after England\u2019s miserable Euro 2016 campaign ended with a shock last-16 exit against minnows Iceland.Hodgson, a decent man whose only crime was being over-promoted, departed in abject misery after being forced to endure a painful grilling in his exit press conference.\u2013 Tawdry tale \u2013Somehow, Allardyce found an even more demeaning way to go down in flames.Despite the warning of Eriksson\u2019s brush with undercover reporters, a tawdry tale that almost cost the Swede the England job in 2006, Allardyce still agreed to exchange gossip and trade secrets with a group of men he didn\u2019t know in a London hotel only days after taking charge.That those men were actually undercover reporters posing as Far East businessmen can\u2019t even have come as that much of a surprise to Allardyce given his own past experience of a secret television investigation that led him to be accused of taking bungs to facilitate transfers \u2014 a charge he was eventually cleared of.Asked by the reporters if it would be a problem for their fictitious agency to get involved in third-party ownership through funding football transfers, which is banned under FIFA rules, Allardyce said he knew of certain agents who were \u201cdoing it all the time\u201d and added: \u201cYou can still get around it. I mean obviously the big money\u2019s here.\u201dHe compounded his error by crassly referring to Hodgson as \u201cWoy\u201d, mimicking his speech impediment, and said the FA had \u201cstupidly spent 870 million pounds\u201d rebuilding Wembley, while also complaining that Prince William, the FA president, had not attended last week\u2019s Euro 2020 launch event in London.Allardyce criticised Hodgson\u2019s approach at Euro 2016, saying he was \u201ctoo indecisive\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t got the personality for public speaking\u201d.Still not finished, he poured scorn on England\u2019s failure at the tournament by saying their players have a \u201cpsychological barrier\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t cope\u201d.It was all too much for the image conscious FA, who summoned Allardyce down to London from his home in Bolton in north-west England before wielding the axe.Mutual consent was the FA\u2019s agreed phrasing, but Allardyce\u2019s admission that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d told the real story.England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate has agreed to take charge of the senior team\u2019s next four matches.But for the second time in three months, the Football Association have to embark on a search for a new man to fill a position that increasingly seems like the very last job any self-respecting coach would want.Breitbart London, Breitbart Sports, English soccerComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I could wake up in the morning and my body could be feeling like s\u2014, but as soon as the bus pulls up to Yankee Stadium and I see that white fence on the upper deck, I\u2019m like, It\u2019s on.\u201d Ortiz played an instrumental Yankee-killing role in Boston\u2019s historic comeback against New York down 0-3 in the 2004 ALCS. He hit a game-winning home run in the tenth in Game Four and then won Game Five for the Red Sox with a walk-off single. He hit three homers in the series and received Most Valuable Players honors. Only Ted Williams hit more home runs against the Yankees among Red Sox players than David Ortiz.\u201cWhen I\u2019m standing in the on-deck circle and I hear all those boos,\u201d the designated hitter describes of his Yankee Stadium experience. \u201cI get this feeling I can\u2019t even describe.

The intensity is just not the same against another team.\u201dThe Sox travel to New York to start a three-game series against the Yankees tonight. The games mark Ortiz\u2019s last against a rival he respects. Rather than limping off the field a shell of his younger self, the designated hitter boasts 37 home runs, a .321 batting average, and 124 RBI this season to lead the Red Sox in all of the big three offensive categories.He plans on continuing his Yankee-killing ways. Ortiz warns that \u201cwhen I hear you boo me, I\u2019m gonna try to hit the ball over that white fence, all the way to the mother******* choo choo train.\u201dCiting Boston\u2019s tolerance of beard\u2019s and the hostility to them in the Bronx, Ortiz notes that he was made to wear a \u201cB\u201d on his cap.

[Mixed-martial arts] is legal pretty much everywhere else in the world. That it\u2019s not in my home state is disheartening. Fighting in Madison Square Garden, or in the Nassau Coliseum, would definitely be a dream come true.\u201dThe company worked for years to receive recognition by the state. But New York remained the last holdout among the fifty states to give its imprimatur to professional mixed-martial arts (MMA) bouts. A union grudge in Nevada against the previous owners of the UFC carried over into New York to effectively ban MMA. The arrest and conviction of Sheldon Silver, the longtime assembly speaker, on federal corruption charges opened up the blockage of the bill in Albany. It passed in April and went into effect earlier this month.The Philadelphian defends the lightweight belt in his first title defense after upsetting Rafael dos Anjos. The Dubliner, who won the featherweight belt in a seven-second knockout of Jose Aldo in December, takes his third fight outside the division since winning the strap. He remains the 145-pound champ despite not defending the title. The 28-4 Alvarez boasts wins over Gilbert Melendez, Michael Chandler, Anthony Pettis, and dos Anjos. The 20-3 McGregor holds notable victories over Nate Diaz, Chad Mendes, Max Holloway, and Aldo.McGregor brings elite, unorthodox striking and knockout power in his left hand to the lightweight division. Alvarez boasts excellent dirty boxing and possesses solid wrestling. Breitbart Sports watched cageside in January as Alvarez neutralized a smaller, quicker, favored fighter, Anthony Pettis, in Boston by using strength, a clinch game, and wrestling to grind Pettis and grab the win. One imagines him using the same strategy against the smaller, quicker, favored McGregor. The Irishman figures to rely on his superior athleticism, reach, and striking.McGregor becomes the first man to simultaneously wear two belts in UFC history should he win. B.J. Penn and Randy Couture rank as the only two fighters to ever win titles in two divisions in the promotion\u2019s 23-year history. Already, King Conor reigns as MMA\u2019s pay-per-view champion, selling over four million subscriptions to his fights in the U.S. alone over the last year. Now he wants a new crown.\u201cThe goal at the end of the day is world titles,\u201d McGregor audaciously told Breitbart Sports last year before he owned a single UFC belt. \u201cLike I said, I came into this promotion as a two-weight world champion. I vacated those belts when I signed with the UFC.

Garner died in police custody and his death sparked protests.

Marlow27 Sep 20160Obama said in an official press release that the golf legend \u201chad swagger before we had a name for it.\u201d The president added, \u201cArnold was the American Dream come to life.\u201dPalmer was a child of the depression born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, 50 miles outside of Pittsburgh in 1929 to Milfred \u201cDeacon\u201d Palmer and his wife Doris. Arnie spent much of his youth helping his father at the Latrobe Country Club, where Deacon worked as the golf course superintendent and later the club\u2019s golf professional. Like his dad Arnie became adroit in the game as well, elevating his game to a high level capturing the U.S. Amateur Championship in 1954. The rest, shall we say, is history, as \u201cThe King\u201d went on to win seven major championships, along with 87 other tournaments, and became the most popular and richest golfer the world has ever seen.But Arnie\u2019s true greatness was his ability to connect with the on-course spectators and living-room sports viewers as golf became more and more popular with the rise of television. Fans idolized him for his down-to-earth personality, his incredible athleticism, willingness to have at it no matter the risk, and his upbeat, high-energy spirit that he brought to the\u00a0game.As Obama said in his press release:Along the way he racked up win after win \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t his success that made him King. Arnold\u2019s freewheeling, fearless approach to the game inspired a generation of golfers and, for the first time on TV, enthralled an audience across the world. Sure, we liked that he won seven majors, but we loved that he went for it when he probably should have laid up. That spirit extended beyond the links where he gave freely of himself and poured everything he had into everything he did: from building hospitals to personally responding to countless letters from his fans. And he did it all with a grin that hinted maybe he had one more shot up his sleeve. It was another presidential golf fanatic that Arnie grew extremely close to over his playing days. World War II hero and 34th president of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower. Palmer wrote in his book, A Golfer\u2019s Life, that he \u201cloved [Eisenhower] like a second father.\u201d He added that after their first playing together in a tournament at Augusta in 1960 \u201cour meetings on the golf course became more frequent and our playing companionship deepened into a genuine friendship that, for me at least, eclipsed any relationship I\u2019d ever had with an older man besides my father. He loved to hear me talk about tour life, and I loved to hear him reminisce about his wartime experiences and reflect on current events.\u201dPalmer liked to tell the story of the time he gave Ike a golf lesson to keep his elbow tucked into his side after noticing the president\u2019s flying right elbow on his back swing. \u201cBless him,\u201d Palmer wrote, \u201clike the good soldier he was, in his determination to keep that right wing tucked as ordered, he\u2019d actually rubbed the skin off his arm.

Pulled all American forces out of the hard-fought gains in Iraq, that literally created a vacuum in which the murderous and barbarous terrorist organization ISIS was able to overrun vast areas that had been hard-won by the American soldier. There are heroes in our midst that served in operation Iraqi freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom. There are Gold Star families among us.

It was Hillary Clinton and her State Department that left Americans in harms way in Benghazi.

She lies even when she doesn\u2019t have to.For instance, while campaigning in Iowa, she told a group of supporters that her grandparents were immigrants to the United States.\u201cAll of my grandparents, you know, came over here,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I sit here and I think, well you\u2019re talking about the second, third generation. That\u2019s me, that\u2019s you.\u201dThe story was untrue. One of her grandparents was an immigrant; three were not.Another time Hillary said, \u201cI actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before [Obama] did\u201d\u2014a statement that earned her a Pinocchio for lying from \u201cThe Fact Checker\u201d in the Washington Post.Hillary lied when she said that she \u201cdid not mail any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.\u201d It turned out that there were more than two thousand such documents on her email server\u2014twenty-two of which were marked \u201cspecial access program,\u201d a level of classification higher than top secret.She lied when she said that she employed her private email \u201cas a convenience\u201d so that she could use a single phone for both work and personal communications. It turned out that she owned several electronic devices and that, in any case, Huma Abedin carried them for her.She lied when she said she had voluntarily turned over all her work emails to the State Department. It turned out that she relinquished those emails only when forced to under subpoena, and that she withheld dozens of Benghazi-related emails she had exchanged with her back-channel fixer Sidney Blumenthal.\u201cClinton has repeated numerous times that the [email] arrangement was \u2018allowed,\u2019 though no one in the administration has ever said they approved her server,\u201d wrote The Hill\u2019s A. B. Stoddard. \u201cSo Democrats\u2014like Republicans\u2014assume she is making a misleading statement about her own unorthodox decision to do something no Cabinet secretary had ever done before.\u201dShe lied when, according to the New York Times, she told the FBI that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to conduct unclassified state business using a private email account. Powell, one of the most respected elder statesmen in the country, quickly denied the report. \u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u201dHillary lied when she said that as secretary of state she did not grant special favors to foreigners who donated money to the Clinton Foundation. As I documented with eyewitness accounts in Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary, wealthy foreign donors who gave millions to the foundation received special treatment. One such donor was a Canadian businessman who was granted permission to sell control of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium production capacity to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the deal went through, Bill Clinton was invited to Moscow to give a speech. He was paid $500,000.\u201cThe Clinton Foundation was ostensibly set up to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d writes David Harsanyi, senior editor at The Federalist. \u201cAlthough it has done some fine work, it\u2019s most fruitful program has been leveraging [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s position in the State Department to enrich her family, friends and cronies. The foundation was a center of influence peddling. Rock stars. Soccer players. Conglomerates. Crown princes. All of them paid in. All of them expected access to the U.S. government.\u201d And most of them got it.Indeed, more than half of the private citizens who were granted access to Hillary while she was at Foggy Bottom\u201485 out of the 154 who got face time or spoke to her\u2014donated to the foundation, for a total of $156 million.The membrane that should have prevented seepage between the State Department and the foundation turned out to be totally permeable. \u201cLaura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation,\u201d reported the New York Post, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Hillary\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d And when Mills wasn\u2019t taking telephone calls from Graham and doing favors for foundation donors, she was traveling to New York City to interview job candidates for a top job at the foundation.The impact of Hillary\u2019s menagerie of lies was reflected in public opinion polls. Sixty percent of Americans considered her \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d And when Gallup asked Americans what word came to mind when they heard the name \u201cHillary Clinton,\u201d a majority replied \u201cdishonest/liar/don\u2019t trust her/poor character.\u201dTo deal with this problem, her friends and campaign staffers set about trying to make Hillary more likeable.\u201cShe needs to try to humanize herself, because in some ways she\u2019s kind of become a cardboard cutout figure,\u201d said liberal historian Douglas Brinkley.But rehabilitating Hillary at this stage in her life (she turns sixty-nine on October 26) was more easily said than done.\u201cHillary still obsesses about money, a narrative thread that has existed since she was thwarted in her desire to build a pool at the governor\u2019s mansion in poor Arkansas and left the White House with a doggie bag full of sofas, rugs, lamps, TVs and china, some of which the Clintons later had to pay for or return,\u201d writes New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. \u201cEven Chelsea was cashing in, getting a ridiculous, $600,000-a-year scion salary from NBC, far greater than that of many of the network\u2019s correspondents. As a Clinton White House aide once explained to me, \u2018Hillary, though a Methodist, thinks of herself like an Episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners, in return for devoting herself to God and good works.\u2019\u201dAnd the social critic Camille Paglia puts it this way: \u201cSo much must be overlooked or discounted\u2014from Hillary\u2019s compulsive money-lust and her brazen indifference to normal rules to her conspiratorial use of shadowy surrogates and her sociopathic shape-shifting in policy positions for momentary expedience.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton, edward klein, Guilty as Sin, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He spoke of the high standards to which those who call themselves Christians are called. Pence then added, \u201cWe all fall short of the glory of God, and there is no one righteous, other than the One.\u201d\u201cThe other part of my faith is, I believe in grace. I believe in forgiveness,\u201d continued Pence. \u201cWe have been forgiven.\u201dIn Pence\u2019s prior acknowledgement of Trump\u2019s apology, he expressed hope that America would see Trump\u2019s heart during the debate. Pence had also said that he was \u201cgrateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.\u201d He then said he was praying for the Trump family.On Monday afternoon in Charlotte, Pence told the crowd that during the debate, Trump indeed \u201cshowed heart, humility; then he fought back.\u201dPence moved on to speak of what the Trump-Pence administration would bring. \u201cThis election, it\u2019s not just a choice between two people; it\u2019s a choice between two futures. \u2026 I choose a stronger America at home and abroad. \u2026 I choose an America that stands up for the constitutional principles.\u201dHe spoke of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will lead to a more prosperous future. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take the advice of Hillary\u2019s husband,\u201d said Pence, referencing former President Bill Clinton\u2019s statements at a rally, where he called Obamacare crazy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to renegotiate NAFTA so it works for the American economy,\u201d said Pence.Pence went on to say that government wants to be involved in every aspect of our lives.He pivoted, then, to the Supreme Court, stating that the\u00a0next president will likely decide\u00a0the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.Pence said the U.S. \u201cmust decide here and now that the person we elect as the next President of the United States is Donald Trump.\u201d This is essential,\u201d he said, \u201cfor sake of the rule of law, the Constitution, life, Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\u201cI was awfully proud of my running mate last night,\u201d Pence said, returning to the subject of Sunday night\u2019s debate. He told the crowd that the media continues to ignore the avalanche of corruptions that come out of the Clintons.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump went out on that stage last night and put the truth before the American people,\u201d Pence said. He then revisited the issues that Clinton\u2019s private foundation took millions from foreign donors as she headed up the State Department, that she destroyed emails from a private server, and her use of high technology to erase emails.Clinton\u2019s private speeches to foreign financial groups came up, as well. Pence referenced the WikiLeaks release of the emails of John Podesta, a close adviser to President Obama. Podesta was also chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and current Chairman of Hillary for America. He spoke of the hemispheric market with \u201cOpen trade and open borders,\u201d documented in the emails, the accuracy of which the Clinton campaign has not refuted.Pence spoke of when he first got to know the Trumps during\u00a0the summer. \u201cTo know the Trumps is to know a family,\u201d said Pence.Pence told the crowd that in Donald Trump and Mike Pence they have two people who\u00a0will fight every day for the American Dream for everyone in this nation.\u201cI truly do believe that now is the time to do all that we can,\u201d said Pence, who suggested that those who are inclined could bend a knee and pray for the country.Clinton and Trump have jockeyed for the advantage, often within the statistical margin of error, in North Carolina polls in the\u00a0past several months. A Real Clear Politics average of five recent polls gives Clinton the current advantage over Trump by 2.6 percent, in part due to a late September poll that gave her a six-point advantage. The most recent poll included in that average, High Point, showed Clinton up just one point. That poll was taken from October 1-6.From the Charlotte event, Pence will continue on to hold an evening event in Fletcher, just outside of Asheville. His wife and daughter have joined him along the campaign trail on Monday in North Carolina.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, barack obama, christian, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Mike Pence, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He challenged her on her emails, her unremarkable record in the U.S. Senate, and her unsuccessful record as Secretary of State. She was defensive yet not adequately defending. Trump reminded people of a few simple facts: she represents a failed, rigged system that benefits the powerful and wealthy; policies that will make Americans less wealthy and ISIS more emboldened; a knack for lying that jumped to a whole new level on Sunday.Trump\u2019s debate win has set off a spiral amid the legacy and establishment media and sent the Clinton campaign into damage control as WikiLeaks published its second of many tranches of emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta on Monday morning.Trump has now moved past the worst stretch in his campaign, the release of a tape in which he is seen and heard making vulgar remarks about women. That set back his effort to gain momentum after his running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s win in the Vice Presidential debate over Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) a week ago.Trump is hitting the campaign trail in the key battleground states of Florida and Pennsylvania early this week as he takes the campaign that Clinton threw into the gutter back to a focus on the issues like trade, immigration, jobs, the economy and national security.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, 2016 presidential election, debate, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, KellyAnne ConwayComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

NBC was the owner of the Access Hollywo0d tape that The Washington Post\u00a0released Friday revealing the GOP nominee using direct and foul language in reference to courtship and the way women interact with celebrities.Falwell told Cosby he was upset by the tape and how it was received by members of his family, but it did not shake his support for the New York City developer.Cosby asked Falwell if his narrative was conjecture and he told her it was based on real conversations he had with people familiar with Republican conspirators.Falwell, who endorsed Trump in January, said, \u201cI just think some of the establishment Republicans\u2014I\u2019m not going to name any names, I\u2019ve got some independent information, but I\u2019m not going\u2026 I\u2019m not going to reveal it on the air\u2014but I think some of the establishment folks who reluctantly endorsed him had this planned all along as a way to slither out of the endorsement, and I think it backfired on them, and I\u2019m glad to see that.\u201dWhen Cosby pressed Falwell, he was more direct: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that it came out right before Trump was supposed to appear with Paul Ryan at a rally, and it conveniently gave Paul Ryan a way to disinvite Trump.\u201dThe Trump surrogate said he has heard for a while from trusted Republican sources that something was being planned that would allow the GOP leaders to take Trump off the ticket.\u201cIt was just something that, that I was told was going to come down in October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would probably result in Trump not being the nominee.\u201dListen to the complete interview here.\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Access Hollywood, Jerry Fawell Jr, Liberty University, Moral Majority, Speaker Paul D.

In several speeches that year, Clinton referred to Xi, who took office in late 2012, as a promising new leader for the communist country, particularly when compared to predecessor Hu Jintao.\u201cThe new president of China is a much more sophisticated actor than his predecessor. He lived in the United States for a short period of time, actually lived in Iowa on a \u2014 on a farm. He was working in agricultural issues within the Communist party, you know, about 30 years ago. He is a better politician than his immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao,\u201d Clinton is quoted as saying in a speech allegedly given to the CME group in November 2013, a year after he took office.The remarks echo a similar quotation from June of that year, where Wikileaks cites Clinton as saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a more sophisticated, more effective public leader than Hu Jintao was. He is political in the kind of generic sense of that word. You can see him work a room, which I have watched him do. You can have him make small talk with you, which he has done with me.\u201dIn that same speech \u2013 remarks at a Goldman Sachs event, according to Wikileaks \u2013 Clinton praised Xi for \u201cdoing much more to try to assert his authority\u201d over the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military. She allegedly argued that Hu had \u201cnever really captured the authority over the PLA that is essential for any government,\u201d turning the PLA into something of a loose cannon \u201cmaking some foreign policy\u201d independent of the civilian authority of Beijing.\u201cSo President Xi is doing much more to try to assert his authority, and I think that is also good news,\u201d she reportedly said.Since Xi took office, the PLA has been significantly more active in the South China Sea, where Xi\u2019s government claims territory belonging to Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. A verdict from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague has done nothing to deter China from continuing to construct military facilities and artificial islands on territory it has no legal sovereignty over in the region.In that same speech, Clinton\u00a0accused the PLA of supporting North Korea, which China has been more vocal in condemning during Xi\u2019s tenure, though China remains Pyongyang\u2019s biggest trade partner and benefactor. \u201cThe biggest supporters of a provocative North Korea has been the PLA. The deep connections between the military leadership in China and in North Korea has really been the mainstay of the relationship,\u201d Wikileaks quotes Clinton as saying:So now all of a sudden new leadership with Xi and his team, and they\u2019re saying to the North Koreans\u2014and by extension to the PLA\u2014no. It is not acceptable. We don\u2019t need this right now. We\u2019ve got other things going on. So you\u2019re going to have to pull back from your provocative actions, start talking to South Koreans again about the free trade zones, the business zones on the border, and get back to regular order and do it quickly.Since Wikileaks claims Clinton made those remarks, praising Xi for getting tough on North Korea, dictator Kim Jong-un has conducted two more nuclear tests. After the earlier of the two, which occurred in January, the Chinese government claimed that containing North Korea was \u201ca U.S. obligation\u201d and that \u201c\u2018the U.S. should not always try to outsource its problems to China.\u201dThe Clinton campaign has not categorically denied the veracity of the documents. Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine said\u00a0he had \u201cno way of knowing the accuracy of documents dumped by this hacking organization\u201d on CNN.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think we can dig in documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume they\u2019re all accurate and true.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Hillary Clinton, National Security, China, Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks, Wikileaks document dumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But what they do reflect is the dedication and enthusiasm of a candidates\u2019 online supporters. Both candidates\u2019 fans have access to the same tools to game the polls \u2014 trolls, bots, etc. Pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record has reportedly spent seven figures on online warfare. Yet Trump fans are still overwhelming the left in this facet of psy-ops, producing screenshot after screenshot of \u201cpolls\u201d showing The Donald ahead.Clinton backers know logically that this phenomenon does not necessarily affect the offline electorate, yet they still feel the need to debunk the meme \u2014 which wastes their time and energy while making them look bitter and defensive.It makes sense, then, that most national conservative sites and local news sites did another round of online snap polls, but at least a half dozen\u00a0left-leaning national outlets skipped them after the second debate.Time MagazineLast time around, Time\u2019s online snap poll went Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 42. Instead of a \u201cwho won the debate\u201d poll, the magazine bizarrely asked: \u201cWhich Presidential Candidate is Better for Your Money?\u201d The current spread on that poll is Trump 89 \u2013 Clinton 11.SlateLast time: Trump 54 \u2013 Clinton 46. This time: Hillary won. She won so much! What does all this winning mean?FortuneFortune had the slimmest margin of most high-profile online polls after the first debate, Trump 51 \u2013 Clinton 49 after 400,000+ votes. This time around, the site\u2019s editors silently skipped a shot at another 400,000 hits.The HillRound one: Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 36 \u2013 Draw 6. Round two: crickets.CBS\u00a0New YorkLast time around, CBS New York\u2019s online poll went roughly Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 42 with ~41,000 votes. Surely it is only a coincidence that the site did not conduct an online poll Sunday night.CNBCWith half as many votes and the same tight margin as Fortune\u2019s 51-49 split, CNBC must have found the result of their last online poll too demoralizing to risk a repeat.Most establishment news outlets are touting a \u201cscientific\u201d poll by CNN and ORC which says that 57 percent of debate watchers declared Clinton the victor on Sunday night. Left out of that top-line figure: 58 percent of their sample \u201csaid they were supporting Clinton before the debate [emphasis added].\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Drudge Poll, Hillary Clinton, Online Poll, Presidential Debate, Snap PollComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In reference to a tweet at close to 3 a.m., Cooper selectively repeated four words of one 25 word tweet:In 2008, you wrote in one of your books the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said if a leader doesn\u2019t have it \u201cHe or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?Trump\u2019s tweet was about Clinton and former beauty queen Alicia Machado, and did mention a sex tape. Clinton used Machado to criticize Trump in the first debate.Trump later responded to criticism of tweeting late at night:For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Trump responded to Cooper, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout. By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who\u2019s going to answer it the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what, she didn\u2019t answer because when ambassador Stevens.\u201dCooper followed up on his question, interrupting Trump:\u00a0\u201cThe question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\u201dTrump continued:Six-hundred times. Well she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning and she also sent a tweet out at 3:00 in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But, she said she\u2019ll be awake.\u2026Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help and the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy by the way. So you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not unproud of it to be honest with you.Cooper then tried to ask Hillary Clinton the same question\u00a0about Trump.\u201cSecretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader.\u201dClinton responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to which Trump said \u201cI\u2019m shocked to hear that.\u201dIn the 2008 presidential primary election, Clinton\u2019s primary election campaign ran a television ad asking viewers who they want answer the phone at the White House at 3 a.m. when \u201csomething\u2019s happening in the world.\u201d She lost that primary election to then-Sen. Barack Obama.Clinton has been criticized for not being more responsive during the terror attack on Americans in Benghazi.

Her record in foreign policy sucks. She has no love for the military. She\u2019s a criminal, and she ought to be in prison. I mean, I\u2019m just being blunt: this is a woman who ought to be in prison right now. If you or I had done what she has done, we would be in handcuffs in an orange suit, and we would be in a maximum security federal prison right now.\u201dClovis said it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d to construe Trump\u2019s call for a special prosecutor during the debate as a banana republic-style threat to jail his political opponent.\u201cDirector Comey has already come out and said she essentially lied to the FBI,\u201d he noted. \u201cMartha Stewart lied to the FBI, and she went to prison. If Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, she ought to be prosecuted. And right now, what we have is, we have a deal struck by the Clinton campaign with the Obama administration, and I think if push comes to shove, I think Obama will pardon her before this thing gets out of hand because if they think anything is going to reveal that she has committed more criminal acts than she already has, then I think he\u2019ll pardon her. I really do. I think this is in the works. And I don\u2019t think the American people are really fooled by this.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is establishing the rule of law, and the rule of law applies to everyone. That includes the former secretary of state,\u201d Clovis declared.Marlow asked how the Trump campaign planned to strategize around the intense media focus on his \u201chot mic\u201d lewd remarks, \u201cconsidering that even the Republican Party is now destroying Donald Trump over these comments.\u201d\u201cWell, I think again it goes to the substance of what we have is, we have a vulnerability in the campaign,\u201d Clovis replied, adding, \u201cThis is a vulnerability. Let\u2019s make no mistake. Let\u2019s be honest about this. We have a situation here, comments that were made 11 years ago. They were recorded, and they\u2019ve come back to haunt the candidate. The candidate has apologized for those remarks.\u201cAnd I think what it goes to is the fact that they don\u2019t want to focus on policy. They don\u2019t want to focus on the substance of the issues\u00a0because the establishments of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party writ large are deeply threatened by a populist movement in this country.\u201cI really think this is why you see these weak-kneed, lily-livered Republicans out here \u2013 I have other words, but I can\u2019t use them on the radio \u2013 that go to the heart of what I think is a despicable display of cowardice on the part of the Republican Party over this whole issue.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to defend the comments. I think the comments were bad, and frankly, if my son had said something like that, I\u2019d have taken him back to the woodshed. I don\u2019t have any problems talking about that and saying that because that\u2019s what I think of the comments.\u201cThe other side of it is, the comments aren\u2019t what we\u2019re after. What we\u2019re after is the substance of who\u2019s going to lead this country. And that\u2019s what we ought to be focused on because the alternative of having Hillary Clinton as President of the United States is just too terrible to contemplate.\u201dAs for the Trump campaign\u2019s short-term 48-hour game plan, Clovis said, \u201cI think what you\u2019re gonna see is, we\u2019re gonna have comments, we\u2019re gonna come out and talk about these issues, gonna go back on the campaign trail, gonna go back out and re-establish the momentum we have talking about the issues, and that\u2019s what Mr. Trump is going to focus on.\u201dHe said Trump would be \u201ccontrite,\u201d and he would \u201cstand up, and at every stop he\u2019s going to say, \u2018Hey, look, I made a mistake. I wasn\u2019t running for president 11 years ago, and what I said was wrong, and it\u2019s hurtful, and I feel bad about it. It was regrettable on my part.\u2019 And then, let\u2019s move on.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s the deal: If the media are going to concentrate on these comments, I really think what we\u2019re looking at is the American people; this will be a backlash,\u201d Clovis predicted. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really focused on here, right now, are the people who are gonna be weak on voting for Donald Trump anyway. And what they\u2019re trying to do is, the media are trying to solidify that vote, that they will take away or get the people who may or may not be committed to Donald Trump. Donald Trump voters are not gonna go away. They\u2019re gonna be there, and I think they\u2019re gonna be there in numbers that we haven\u2019t polled yet.\u201dClovis said he doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat Speaker Ryan or the rest of the party is up to,\u201d but guessed there are \u201csome concerns on the establishment side on down-ballot issues.\u201d He disputed the idea that Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was faring poorly enough to make the Republican\u2019s hold on the House tenuous: \u201cMy own experience in electoral politics is that this coattail thing is way overblown. People are going to go in and vote for the president. If they like their congressman or woman, they\u2019re going to vote for them. If they like their senator, they\u2019re going to vote for them. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s at the top of the ticket, and all the other issues that are ongoing there. I just don\u2019t believe that that is as strong a phenomenon as a lot of other people would like to put out.\u201dHe went on to say, \u201cWhat I do think is, there are a lot of people who are concerned about how the chess table will look, once the election is over, and whether or not you\u2019re going to have people that you can control inside the Republican caucus. If you have a majority \u2013 and I think we\u2019ll hold on to the House, I think the Senate, you know, it could be problematic.\u201d\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he asserted, \u201cwe see most of the senators are running strong races, and it looks like we\u2019re going to hold the Senate in the Republican Party. So I think what a lot of this is about is what the chess table\u2019s going to look like when it\u2019s over, win or lose. If Trump wins, that covers up a lot of quirks and blemishes. If he doesn\u2019t win, then I think the Republican Party is going to retrench and double down. I think you\u2019re going to see an even stronger divide between the conservative and populist movement in the Republican Party, and the establishment/big government side.\u201dClovis predicted that the\u00a0\u201cproblem in the Republican Party is not going away.\u201d He elaborated by saying that \u201cthis is something that\u2019s going to manifest itself for the next three to five election cycles, and we\u2019ll have to see who\u2019s going to win. I really think this is a struggle that the Republican Party, and especially the leaders of the Republican Party, are gonna have to come to grips with because this coalition that Donald Trump\u2019s put together is not like any we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dClovis thought Trump\u2019s top moment in the second debate was \u201cthe Lincoln comment that he laid on Mrs. Clinton.\u201d\u201cI think the low moment really was in the first 15 or 20 minutes,\u201d he continued. \u201cI cannot tell you how much I deplore the TMZ style of these debates. And let me add another lowlight: I had a lot of confidence in Anderson Cooper. I have somewhat of a relationship with him, a professional relationship, and I really have always liked him. I don\u2019t think he covered himself in glory last night, and I thought Martha Raddatz was horrible.

And the fact is that, you know, I \u2014 as I said on Saturday, you know, I couldn\u2019t condone, I couldn\u2019t defend those remarks. I encouraged Donald Trump on Friday to apologize for them. He did. He expressed his personal remorse.\u201dBut I also encouraged him Saturday to take that to the American people to show his heart. And when he said on national television he wasn\u2019t proud of it, he was embarrassed by it, I do believe that he expressed himself straight from his heart to the American people.\u00a0But \u2014 but then he moved on. And in the next 90 minutes, the American people saw a dramatic choice between someone who is speaking boldly about the challenges facing this country, and someone who, when their confronted with their own record, when they\u2019re confronted with the controversies unfurling out of the Clinton Foundation, or her speeches on Wall Street, just obfuscated or ignored or refused to respond. And I \u2014 I think in Donald Trump you\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s willing to step up, speak boldly and plainly from his heart and his mind and\u00a0Hillary Clinton, when she\u2019s confronted on speeches on Wall Street, she gave us a one minute lecture on Abraham Lincoln and never answered any of the questions that were posed.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Alisyn Camerota, CNN, Mike Pence, New DayComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

There's not a close second. https://t.co/b3Y4Y9wZqRby Jeff Poor10 Oct 20160Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski weighed in on the debate a night earlier between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Scarborough declared Trump to be the his most effective debate performance to date and theorized that Republicans that jumped ship from Trump\u2019s candidacy are wishing they had not at this point.\u201cI think despite what you think of Donald Trump, what you think of Hillary Clinton, what you think of how this race has gone over the weekend and where you think it\u2019s going to end up, whether you think last night made any difference at all to the final outcome in November,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cI think there are a couple of things that people in the press may not want to admit, but it was plainly evident watching it on TV last night. Number one, it was Donald Trump\u2019s most effective debate performance to date. There\u2019s not a close second. Just not a close second. Secondly, despite the fact she had an unprecedented cheering section in the media, the fact is for somebody watching and people will see this if they watch it again today or so parts of it a week from now or a month from now \u2013 Hillary Clinton was on the defensive most of the night.\u201d\u201cShe seemed unsure of herself most of the night and he dominated the second debate in the same way she dominated the first debate. And third, and I think most importantly for this political season, Donald Trump, who has made the Republican Party members lives living and breathing hells for the past year and a half, last night turned it up to 11. And all of those people that jumped ship about halfway through the debate were looking at their TV saying, \u2018Oh shoot.\u2019 Because \u2014 I know everybody in the press hates Donald Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m giving you reality if you don\u2019t like it. He\u2019s horrible. I heard it last night. I saw it on Twitter. I understand. You believe he\u2019s an evil man. I\u2019m just giving you the political reality and this is the political reality \u2013 that for the Republican base, Donald Trump delivered the attack against the Clinton machine that the Republican base and Middle America have been waiting for years now.\u201d\u201cAnd so good luck being in Pensacola, FL, saying I\u2019m off of Donald Trump or saying in Kansas, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not for Donald Trump anymore,\u2019 especially when no Republican in America should have been surprised by what they heard on Friday,\u201d Scarborough added.Brzezinski seemed to agree, calling it \u201cvintage Trump.\u201d\u201cNo Republican in America could have done what he did last night,\u201d she sad. \u201cThey just \u2014 my god.

LOUIS, Missouri0Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, crushed his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton in Sunday evening\u2019s debate at Washington University in St. Louis\u2014propelling him closer to the White House and past, perhaps, the roughest stretch of his campaign yet.\u201cIt was an absolute home run for Mr. Trump,\u201d Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, told Breitbart News in the spin room after the debate. \u201cThis was a game-changing victory. You know what? The underdog is back.\u201dSeveral key exchanges in the debate proved Trump to be the better candidate on Sunday night, the most important of which was when\u00a0Trump forced out on his own with no help from moderators CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz: when Trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the Clinton email scandal.Trump held his own through six straight questions with which\u00a0Raddatz and others peppered him, opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s nephew Billy Bus; then when Hillary Clinton brought up the birther questions again\u2014trying to force that into the conversation\u2014Trump trapped her.\u201cHe [Trump] owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words,\u201d Clinton said, regarding the birther issue.After detailing how\u00a0it is actually Hillary Clinton who owes President Obama an apology because she started the birther narrative\u2014it\u2019s been proven that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign, as did at least two people on Clinton\u2019s campaign\u2014Trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails.\u201cBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing,\u201d Trump said, before dropping the mega-bomb: a\u00a0special prosecutor to independently investigate Clinton. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor,\u201d Trump said, adding:When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been \u2014\u00a0destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.After Clinton accused Trump of \u201clies\u201d without detailing any, and as Raddatz attempted to intervene to save her, she begged the so-called \u201cfact checkers\u201d for help.\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d she added.In response, Trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201dAnother key moment came when Raddatz tried to press Trump on his plan to temporarily halt Islamic migration into America from nations with terrorism problems. Hillary Clinton, in her previous answer\u2014in a response to an Islamophobia question from an audience member\u2014had attacked Trump over the Khan Gold Star family controversy again. Trump, in his reply to Raddatz\u2019s question, flipped the whole thing back on Clinton\u2014who, unlike Trump, supported the war in Iraq.\u201cFirst of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today because, unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo he would have been alive today.\u201d\u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands\u2026\u201dRaddatz then interrupted him.\u201cExcuse me. Excuse me,\u201d Trump talked over her.\u201cAnd why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026\u201d Raddatz asked over Trump\u2019s talking.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time,\u201d Trump asked Raddatz, speaking directly at the moderator.\u201cI do,\u201d Raddatz said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you interrupt her?\u201d Trump followed up.The moderators interrupted Trump 26 times\u2014and Clinton only 12 times\u2014a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors. \u201cWould you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\u201d Raddatz interjected again.\u201cIt\u2019s called extreme vetting,\u201d Trump said. He continued:We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values, and we know nothing about their love for our country.There were many other moments throughout the debate\u2014from exchanges on Obamacare to more about refugees to dealing with Russia and Syria and even campaign finance\u2014and\u00a0Trump defeated Clinton on all of them. After the moderators could not stump Trump in the opening, and he steamrolled ahead in the early momentum, she could not catch a break all night.Trump\u2019s debate victory\u2014which comes after a rough first debate with Clinton back on September 26, an eternity ago in this race, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s win last Tuesday in Virginia in the vice presidential debate against\u00a0Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)\u2014puts perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign behind him. A videotape of him making lewd remarks about women surfaced on Friday, and jittery establishment Republicans showed initial signs of a full-scale collapse of support for him. That was followed by an apology video late Friday night from Trump, a WikiLeaks document dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s personal emails, a rough-and-tumble, but effective, showing from several women who have accused Bill Clinton of allegedly raping or sexually assaulting them, and now this debate performance. With each of those developments and more, Trump seems to have put that stage of the campaign behind him and returned to the offensive position\u2014riding high into political battle\u2014moving into the final month of the campaign.The videotape threatened to derail Trump\u2019s campaign, as it prompted several senior Republicans to call on him to withdraw and hand the nomination away to his running mate or someone else. Trump has doubled down and refuses to quit on his supporters\u2014and, sure enough, the tape found its way to center stage at the debate\u2019s opening. Trump was pressed on it a whopping six times before he finally\u2014as he hinted he would before the debate when tweeting out video interviews that Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers did with Breitbart News, then appearing with them at an event here in Missouri\u2014lit into Hillary Clinton for enabling Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior.But not only did Trump survive; he thrived. In the chaotic environment\u2014as he described it as \u201cone on three,\u201d with the moderators working to help Clinton far more than to help him\u2014Trump found his groove again and soared to a much-needed debate victory. The win not only stops the bleeding from a rough patch of the campaign, but propels him forward into the week like a cannonball onto the homestretch, with one final debate to go in Las Vegas a week from Wednesday. Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, noted that Trump does his best with his back against the wall.\u201cI think Donald Trump loves being the underdog, and this was fantastic,\u201d Miller told Breitbart News. \u201cI think what we saw tonight is a presidential leader in Donald Trump, who stepped up, is ready to lead, and that he\u2019s not going to back down to anybody. Hillary Clinton was rattled\u2014completely rattled\u2014the entire evening. She couldn\u2019t answer on crazy Obamacare. She couldn\u2019t answer on taxes. She couldn\u2019t answer on the emails. You could see everything, from her face was rattled to her inability to give clear answers to the voters who were there. I think if you\u2019re at home and you\u2019re watching, and you think about that person who is out there and what it would look like if she were across the table from a foreign leader, I\u2019d be nervous that she wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up and defend this country. I think one candidate came across as very presidential tonight and that was Donald Trump.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton, 2016 presidential campaign, 2016 presidential election, Anderson Cooper, debate, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, martha raddatzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

We\u2019re going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\u201cShe,\u201d of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton\u2019s plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is \u201cdown to 1 percent.\u201d In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump\u2019s statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump\u2019s assessment of the U.S. as having \u201cjust about the highest\u201d taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying \u201cjust about.\u201d More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he\u2019s talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates \u2013 America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world \u2013 currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico\u2019s unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America\u2019s top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America\u2019s were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, corporate income tax, Donald TrumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Wade and who will overturn the First Amendment protections in Citizens United. Then, following Trump\u2019s defense of the Second Amendment, Clinton added:I respect the Second Amendment [pause] but I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole, we have to save as many lives as we possibly can.A couple of points need to be made: California has comprehensive background checks, which means they have no \u201cgun show loophole\u201d and no \u201conline loophole.\u201d Yet all this gun control was powerless to prevent the December 2 San Bernardino attack. It was powerless to prevent the June 1 UCLA murder-suicide and the fatal October 8 attack on Palm Springs police officers.Washington state has comprehensive background checks too, and on September 23 the state witnessed a mass shooting\u2013five killed\u2013in a Burlington mall.Paris, France has comprehensive background checks too. And on January 7, 2015 they witnessed 12 innocents gunned down at Charlie Hebdo headquarters and another 130 gunned down during the November 13 firearm-based terror attack.Clinton has made clear she will use executive action to secure gun control if Congress refused to go along with her.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Even so, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.It has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama\u2019s is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that\u2019s not what Trump said.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, 1929 crash, Donald Trump, Great RecessionComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak9 Oct 20160CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, for one, said tt the debate was a \u201cwash.\u201d His colleague, Gloria Borger, said:\u00a0\u201cHe may have done enough to stop the bleeding. I\u2019m not sure any minds were changed at this debate tonight. I think so much has occurred over the last 48 hours and this last week\u00a0that people have\u00a0to digest all of this, including the debate tonight, to see where they stand.\u201d Co-panelist Mike Smerconish declared Trump the winner \u201con points\u201d: \u201cI think the night belongs to Donald Trump,\u201d he said. But Smerconish\u00a0added that Trump had fallen short, regardless: \u201cDid he grow the tent? I can\u2019t see that there was any outreach.\u201dTrump beat Clinton despite facing a three-on-one press from his opponent and from the moderators, who were at least as biased as they had been in any of the previous debates. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper fired repeated follow-ups at Trump while leaving Clinton largely alone. But he, at least, brought up tough questions for Clinton on occasion.\u00a0ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz actively debated Trump at times, and silenced the audience when it cheered for Trump \u2014 though not for Clinton.Still, Trump overcame that hostility and pressed Clinton effectively on the issues, as well as on her weakest points \u2014 the email scandal, Benghazi, and Obamacare. He was on better ground than Clinton when it came to citing facts, and he forced her into repeating the rather serious lie that the only emails she deleted from her private server were personal in nature. He also stood his ground on substantive policy questions while maintaining his cool \u2014 for the most part \u2014 when she tried\u00a0personal attacks.The media had largely\u00a0declared the presidential race for Hillary Clinton Saturday, after many Republicans criticized Trump over comments he made in 2005 about groping women. The comments were captured by a live mic and surfaced Friday. Chuck Todd, political director of NBC News, said \u201cthe presidential race is over,\u201d according to Republicans with whom he spoke. Despite Trump\u2019s debate win, the media will be\u00a0reluctant\u00a0to let go of that narrative, with many cheering for his demise.At the first debate, Trump refrained from placing any of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the front row, despite threatening to do so. This time, with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign hitting Trump over his old remarks, Trump more than delivered on the threat, holding a press conference with four of Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers \u2014 who also accused Hillary Clinton of trying to silence and slander them \u2014 before the debate, and placing them in the front row.The Donald Trump that debated Hillary Clinton in St. Louis was better prepared, more passionate, and more focused on the issues than he was two weeks ago. He won, under incredible pressure.The voters will see it, even if the media will not.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

And Much More", "id": "post-5226287", "content": "by Raheem Kassam9 Oct 20160But it has, with this headline, perhaps betrayed the fact that U.S. foreign policy has been mainly steered by one, internationalist, globalist cabal by taking the self-declared extraordinary step of slamming Donald Trump.Foremostly, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, David Rothkopf, is a Democrat who helped President Bill Clinton sign the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) while serving as\u00a0U.S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade.And how could we possibly believe this is anything remotely exceptional when the history and present of Foreign Policy (FP) magazine is so tied up with the globalist establishment?It was founded by Samuel P. Huntingdon, of \u201cClash of Civilizations\u201d fame\u00a0and a life-long Democrat and foreign policy hawk.Huntington noted in 2004 that the global elites \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations\u201d.CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT\u00a0FOR PEACEFP was bought by the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a globalist think tank founded by internationalist Andrew Carnegie. To give further context to this, the current President is\u00a0William J. Burns \u2013 the former\u00a0United States Deputy Secretary of State (2011-14). In other words, he worked for Hillary Clinton.WASHINGTON POST\u00a0Carnegie sold FP to the Washington Post group in 2008.When the\u00a0Washington Post \u2013 which has been an integral media ally of the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 bought FP, it was losing around $1.3m a year. But it was considered so integral to helping push a neoconservative, hawkish foreign policy, that it was worth the loss.The chairman of the Washington Post group in 2008 was Donald E. Graham, who said of the acquisition: \u201cForeign Policy is a terrific magazine, and I\u2019m pleased it will become a part of our company\u2026 Foreign Policy furthers our commitment to great magazine journalism and gives us another opportunity to expand our journalism online\u201d.SLATE GROUPIn 2008, Foreign Policy was moved into the Slate group, the home of the left-wing Slate magazine.Slate\u2019s editor in chief is Jacob Weisberg, an NPR contributor, left-wing New Republic contributor, New York Times contributor, contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and columnist for the Financial Times.FP Group\u2019s Media Kit promotes Hillary Clinton as its foremost recent contributorGRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANYWhen Amazon owner Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, he did not buy the loss-making Foreign Policy magazine with its declining readership. Alexa.com, which is a site ranking organisation run by Amazon itself, reveals Foreign Policy to be the\u00a09719th website in the world compared to its competitor the Economist, which is the\u00a01,935th website.Instead, the magazine stayed with the aforementioned Donald Graham, who changed the name of the Washington Post group to Graham Holdings Company to reflect the sale of the paper.The magazine now operates under the FP Group, headed up by David Rothkopf.Rothkopf, to square FP\u2019s historical circle, is a scholar of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. He was a managing director at Kissinger Associates,\u00a0former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s New York-based consulting firm which was founded alongside\u00a0Mack McLarty, President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff.But greater still, Rothkopf himself served as U.S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade under\u00a0the Clinton Administration in 1993, when Mr. Clinton was signing NAFTA\u00a0which Donald Trump has pledged to reform.DONALD E. GRAHAMGraham, the Chairman and CEO of the company that owns Foreign Policy magazine, is married to Amanda Bennett, a Bloomberg journalist who has just moved to Voice of America.In 2014, the pair founded a \u201cmultimillion dollar National Scholarship Fund\u201d for the children of illegal immigrants in the United States.The organisation has solicited large donations from many Hillary Clinton supporters such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Fernandez Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and a whopping $5m from Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg.\u2018BREAKING WITH TRADITION\u2019Foreign Policy magazine\u2019s claim to be \u201cbreaking with tradition\u201d in endorsing Hillary Clinton is anything but accurate.Perhaps it has never written an editorial, but its entire editorial line and history is, in and of itself, a tradition of endorsing globalist, neoconservative, pro open borders policies and candidates.The idea that this is somehow a big deal is a total farce.Follow Raheem Kassam on Twitter2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, carnegie endowment for peace, david e graham, foreign policy, Hillary Clinton, Slate, Washington PostComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He continued, \u201cIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, mine are words, and his was action. His was \u2014 what he h\u2019s done to women, there\u2019s never been anybody in history of politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women, so you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women, and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped, at 12. Her client, she represented, got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasion, laughing at the girl who was raped. \u2026 So, don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say, but what President Clinton did, he was impeached. He lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine, to one of the women, Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight, and I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that, and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\u201dClinton responded, \u201cWell, first, let me start by saying, that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country. That\u2019s his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all. When they go low, you go high.\u201dShe continued, \u201cAnd, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in video, or the man on the stage respects women, but he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\u201d She then listed the Khan family, Judge Curiel, Serge Kovaleski, and the birther theory about President Obama as things Trump hasn\u2019t apologized for. She then said, \u201cHe owes the president an apology. He owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\u201dTrump then stated, \u201cWell, you owe the president an apology, because, as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal, he\u2019s another real winner that you have, and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So, you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around. Your campaign sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.

LOUIS, Missouri0ST. LOUIS, Missouri \u2014 Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, appeared with three alleged sexual assault victims of former President Bill Clinton in the hours before he debates Clinton\u2019s wife, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, here at Washington University. The women\u2014Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick\u2014have each leveled various charges against Bill Clinton. They also each have charged that Hillary Clinton was an \u201cenabler\u201d of Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News\u2019 Aaron Klein published on Sunday.In addition, Kathy Shelton\u2014who was allegedly raped when she was 12 years old, while Hillary Clinton defended her accused rapist\u2014spoke as well.Before the event started, a leftist\u00a0reporter\u00a0yelled at Trump: \u201cMr. Trump, does your star power allow you to touch women without their consent?\u201dThen Trump, ignoring the reporter, opened the panel event and said: \u201cThank you very much for coming, and these four very courageous women have asked to be here and it was our honor to help them. I think we\u2019re each going to make just an individual short statement, and then we will have a little meeting and we will see you at the debate.\u201dWATCH THE VIDEO:Jones, who kicked it off, said, \u201cI\u2019m here to support Mr. Trump because he\u2019s going to make America great again, and I think everybody else should vote for him.\u201cI think they should all look at the fact that he is a good person, he\u2019s not what other people have been saying he\u2019s been, not Hillary\u2014so think about that,\u201d Jones said.Shelton then said, \u201cI\u2019m also here to support Trump.\u201d She stated that \u201cat 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through.\u201d\u201cShe says she\u2019s for women and children,\u201d Shelton added, noting that Hillary Clinton stands against women and children because she was caught \u201claughing on tape\u201d last year when asked about her case.Broaddrick went next. \u201cI\u2019m here to support Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted it, that actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201dWilley, who was the last to speak on the short panel, noted as well that \u201cI am here to support Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cThe reason for that is the first day that he announced for president he said, \u2018I love this country and I want America to be great again.\u2019 And I cried when he said that because I think this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Willey said. \u201cI think that we can do anything. I think we can accomplish anything. I think that he can bring peace to this world. And I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point.\u201dWhen Trump wrapped the event, which was broadcast live on his Facebook page, the same reporter shouted more questions.\u201cMr. Trump, have you touched women without their consent?\u201d the reporter shouted multiple times.Jones, after the reporter wouldn\u2019t stop harassing Trump and the panel, fired back: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t y\u2019all go ask Bill Clinton that? Go ahead\u2014ask Hillary as well.\u201dThe room erupted in applause for Jones.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, kathy shelton, Paula JonesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Medical staff were initially able to resuscitate the 15 year old, and took her to hospital, but she died yesterday of what toxicology reports indicate was a cocaine overdose.Shortly after the girl was discovered in Innsbruck, police brought a Syrian man in for questioning in relation to the case. The 22 year old told officials that he and a friend had watched through a window and seen two Moroccan men moving the girl to the stairwell.In subsequent interrogations, police found the Syrian\u2019s story to be full of contradictions and a second Syrian national was questioned. Eventually, they had to admit the girl had consumed drugs and alcohol in their apartment.The two men had moved the girl outside when she lost consciousness as they were afraid they would get in trouble with the police, the Tiroler Tageszeitung reported.The two men, both of whom have been granted asylum, are blaming one another for the girl\u2019s death. \u201cThey accuse each other. One Syrian says that the other gave the girl the cocaine and vice versa\u201d, an investigator working on the case told Kronen Zeitung.According to the spokesman for the Innsbruck prosecutor, Hansj\u00f6rg Mayr, the men are suspected of giving narcotic drugs to a minor and of failure to assist a wounded person.

And in that vein, he followed through Chicago and New York, with each speech and interview leaving less and less doubt that he indeed was there primarily to engage in the former US First Lady\u2019s comeback campaign, to eventually sign off at the annual Clinton Foundation party and then fly back to the UK.Feeling compelled to keep the new London Mayor in check as his unlikely former competitor for the parliamentary seat of Tooting (which he ditched just six days after being elected to run for the current job), I advised not to raise the hopes too high even before he crossed the pond. And after a number of gaffes\u00a0and bad publicity, I questioned on Breitbart\u2019s Sirius XM whether his trip was at all good value for money from the taxpayers\u2019 perspective.As I remarked, the purpose of the trip was advertised to us here as showing Americans that \u201cLondon is open for business and should remain a key destination for North American investment\u201d. Instead Sadiq Khan\u2019s trip made the news for repeated expressions of support for Hillary Clinton and continuous bashing of the potential future American President Donald Trump\u2026 Hardly good for business!And to seal the bad taste left by breaching diplomatic protocol, the Chicago papers picked up on Mayor\u2019s connection to the\u00a0famous anti-Semite, Nation of Islam\u2019s Louis\u00a0Farrakhan on the eve of his arrival in the city, which ensured that only the craziest of mad CEOs would at that stage want anything to do with him \u2014 or London.I made a point on Sirius XM that I was becoming worried the overall value-added effect of his trip, resulting from all these mishaps and shenanigans, on our great capital city might be negative. The lost opportunities and businesses pulling out over time are obviously hard to quantify. However, what could\u00a0be checked was the direct cost to the taxpayers.And so, I obtained the full cost of the trip for the London Mayor and his staff from the London City Hall, which came to \u00a339,806. To put that figure in a perspective, the average UK salary in 2016 was \u00a327,600, meaning that a reasonably well-paid individual could have been put in charge of promoting London to the USA for a period of a year instead. Given the major beneficiary of that disastrous trip was Hillary Clinton, we should really be billing these costs to her campaign.\u201cAlea iacta est\u201d (The die is cast) \u2013 the London Mayor chose to campaign for Hillary Clinton, and did so at London taxpayers\u2019 expense. Now is the time for the Clinton campaign to compensate the London taxpayers to the tune of $50,000.2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart London, Hillary Clinton, london mayor, sadiq khanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

To qualify for permanent residency, EU migrants must have lived in Britain for five years.In a potentially controversial move, the department is set to grant amnesty to the 600,000 EU nationals who don\u2019t qualify.A senior source at the Home Office told the Telegraph: \u201cThe remaining people will, of course, be allowed to stay in the UK. That\u2019s a given. We just need to work out exactly how we do it.\u201dWhile the government maintains it is still committed to reduce immigration to \u201cthe tens of thousands\u201d, former borders chief Rob Whiteman has revealed illegal migration is out of control and very little is being done about it.Noting that 84,000 illegal entrants were caught in the UK last year, Mr Whiteman said this figure was \u201cat best\u201d just half the number who managed to slip in.He explained: \u201cIt is not unreasonable to assume that the number detected is only a proportion of the number trying. I would have thought the number caught is at best half.\u201cThe border is porous beyond our main ports. Britain is incredibly close to the rest of Europe so people will gain entry into the country through little harbours, inlets and airfields which are often not covered routinely.\u201cIf you have the money I suspect it\u2019s easy to get into the UK. The agency has three cutters. Your chances of getting across the Channel are good. In Australia a great deal of the navy\u2019s time is given over to border protection,\u201d he added.Mr Whiteman, who was chief executive of the UK Border Agency from 2011 to 2013, also disclosed that resources are used to target high-risk foreigners while other illegal immigrants are largely left alone.Just 5,810 foreigners illegally in the UK were removed last year, while asylum claims \u2014 77, 440 of which are currently in progress \u2014 are at their highest level since 2004.Mr Whiteman stated: \u201cThe number of illegal migrants reaching the country is far greater than the rate at which we are deporting people.\u201cEither we have to put considerable new resources and policies into removal, including holding more people in detention, or accept there are a large number of people living in the country who are not allowed to live here but neither are they facing deportation.\u201dWorking at the Home Office under Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Whiteman was forced to slash the \u00a32 billion budget by a quarter.\u201cIf the public is ever going to be reassured we have to talk about the fact that there is a large amount of illegal migration that is not being dealt with.\u201cEither the Home Office needs more staff or we accept the situation isn\u2019t going away,\u201d he said.Border, Breitbart London, Immigration, Brexit, EU migrants, illegal immigration, UK Border Agency, UK Home OfficeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The far-right National Front plans its own anti-migrant protest later in the day.The National Front is urging mayors to resist the Calais relocation plan and is organizing or taking part in protests across the country this month. Resistance to immigration is central to the campaign platform of National Front leader Marine Le Pen in her bid for the French presidency in elections next year.National Front politicians were also present at a protest Saturday in Forges-les-Bains south of Paris. About 200 people marched through town, past the farmers\u2019 market, school and town hall to protest the recent arrival of about 40 Afghan migrants relocated from Calais to an unused building in the center of town.President Francois Hollande has pledged to close the Calais camp before winter and relocate as many as 9,000 migrants living there to 164 sites around France while they\u2019re cases are examined. The Calais camp has been an embarrassment to the French government and symbol of Europe\u2019s failure to find solutions to the migrant crisis.Pierrefeu residents hostile to the migrants say they fear the newcomers will threaten security, and worry about potential tensions with the psychiatric patients.\u201cEven if we can understand the dismantling of Calais \u2026 our small towns are not the solution for this dismantling. We are too small to host so many people,\u201d said Mayor Patrick Martinelli.

The bear was so close they could hear it breathing.At first, the other kids didn\u2019t believe their cousin when she said a polar bear was nearby. And then they started running\u00a0\u2014 and so did the \u201cever big\u201d\u00a0polar bear.\u201cThat polar bear started running towards them,\u201d said Kikoak. \u201cAnd one of my twins, she was maybe about six feet away from the stairs [of the house], but she was so in shock to see that polar bear,\u00a0she was just standing there looking at it. And it didn\u2019t move. It kept on staring at her.\u201dKikoak said\u00a0her niece, who was inside the house with her and the rest of the children, thought fast and grabbed a skipping rope. She then tossed one\u00a0end to Kikoak\u2019s\u00a0six-year-old\u00a0daughter, who was still frozen in shock.The young girl held onto the end of the rope, said Kikoak, and was\u00a0pulled towards the house.\u201cAnd once she reached the stairs [my niece] grabbed her by her jacket and put her on the stairs,\u201d Kikoak said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how she saved my daughter.\u201dEarlier in September, in a different part of the Arctic, a group of five Russian researchers on Troynoy Island were besieged by a group of a dozen\u00a0ravenous adult polar bears which ate one of their dogs and caused them to run out of flares. A helicopter had to rescue them with a supply of more flares \u2013 and three puppies to replace the eaten hound. They weren\u2019t allowed guns because Russian law forbids the killing of polar bears because \u2013 supposedly \u2013 they are an endangered species.Meanwhile, in Svalbard, Norway \u2013 where polar bear populations have increased by 42 per cent since 2004 \u2013 polar bears are becoming an increasing problem in inhabited areas, with more and more having to be shot to protect humans.\u201cFour polar bears have been shot so far this year,\u201d Vidar Arnesen, a chief police inspector for the governor of Svalbard, told Reuters. \u201cIn a normal year, one or two would be shot.\u201d\u201cThere are more contacts between humans and the animals,\u201d he said aboard the Polarsyssel, the governor\u2019s ship, used for inspections and rescue operations.\u201dSvalbard was the site of a horrific incident in 2011 when Horatio Chapple, an English schoolboy on an expedition organised by the British Schools Exploring Society was killed in his tent by a\u00a0marauding bear. The bear mauled and wounded four other adventurers before it was finally shot.Polar bears, as we know, have a special status as the poster children of the manmade global warming \u201cit\u2019s all our fault and the planet is doomed due to our selfishness, greed and refusal to amend our carbon-guzzling lifestyles\u201d movement.But despite the best efforts of environmentalists to have the bear classified as \u201cEndangered\u201d, it remains stubbornly one notch below on the IUCN Red List in the merely \u201cVulnerable\u201d category.Even this, though, is probably an exaggeration. As even the (uber green) IUCN was forced to admit last year, polar bear populations are not declining.Indeed, in the last fifty years their population has increased five- or six-fold from around 5,000 to between 22,000 and 31,000.Just like global warming theory, the entire greenie case for the polar bear being in any kind of danger rests not on real life observations but on computer modelled projections and idle speculation.With polar bears, the theory runs that declining summer sea ice is depriving them of their hunting territory, causing them either to starve to death or drown on their desperate hunt for food. This theory is nonsense, for a number of reasons outlined here, including the facts that polar bears are excellent swimmers and that there has been no evidence to corroborate this theory \u2013 quite the opposite, in fact, with some populations appearing to benefit from shorter sea ice seasons. In any case, even if it were a problem, the Arctic is currently on a freezing trend not a warming one.A far bigger threat to polar bears \u2013 and to humans too \u2013 is that their populations are simply too healthy. This means that there is inevitably going to be an excess of young males foraging further afield for food, as polar bear expert Susan Crockford explains.In the polar bear entry for the encyclopedia, \u201cWild Mammals of North America,\u201d Steven Amstrup wrote (2003:602):\u201c\u2026 Age structure data show that subadults aged 2-5years survive at lower rates than adults, probably because they are still learning hunting and survival skills.\u201d\u2026\u201cI once observed a 3-year-old subadult that weighed only 70 kg in November. This was near the end of the autumn period in which Beaufort Sea bears reach their peak weights, and his cohorts at that time weighed in excess of 200 kg. This young animal apparently had not learned the skills needed to survive and was starving to death.\u201d [my bold]All this means the last line of this article is indeed true:\u201cThe possibilities of a hungry bear encountering a human being are increasing,\u201d said Lambertini.More problems with young males is what living with a healthy population of polar bears looks like, which means more bears will have to be shot in self-defense.Experts have been predicting this problem for some time. It has nothing to do with global warming and almost everything to do with the near-worldwide ban on polar bear hunting, which hitherto kept populations in manageable numbers.Ian Stirling, 1974:\u201cDr. Stirling felt that complete cessation of hunting, such as exists in Norway, may increase bear-man conflicts. Dr. Reimers replied that the careful harvesting of polar bears was probably desirable, but the total ban now in effect was largely an emotional and political decision rather than a biological one. Last year four bears were killed in self-defense.\u201d [my bold]\n(1974 PBSG meeting \u201cNorway \u2013 progress reported by [Thor] Larsen\u201d; Anonymous 1976:11).Stephen Amstrup, 2013:\u201cWe have predicted in no uncertain times [sic \u2013 terms?] that as bears become hungrier as the sea ice absence period is longer, more and more of these animals are going to be venturing into communities, venturing into villages, raiding food caches, getting into garbage, and even attacking people. So we predict these kinds of events are going to be more frequent and more severe because of climate change.\u201d [my bold]\n(The Guardian, November 4, 2013).Crockford is the author of a Jaws-style thriller on ravenous polar bears killing humans called Eaten.\u00a0At least one polar scientist who has read it considers its \u201cscience-based scenario\u201d to be frighteningly plausible.In field-level polar bear management circles, people don\u2019t talk about the kind of scenario that forms the premise of this novel as an \u201cif\u201d. Instead, they describe it as a \u201cwhen\u201d and they are not looking forward to it.Eek.Breitbart London, Environment, Arctic, canada, Eaten, Horatio Chapple, polar bears, sea ice, Susan Crockford, svalbard, TuktoyaktukComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

That is: not talking about reality. If they don\u2019t talk about reality, others will. That\u2019s the name of the game.I\u00a0believe it\u2019s all in everyone\u2019s interest in Europe to have honest, frank, political forces in a country, responsible political parties who talk about the truth, who talk about the reality on the ground because that\u2019s the only way to understand the nature of the problem.He noted the challenge of trying to be open about migration because the press, according to Kov\u00e1cs\u2026is going to describe you as, let\u2019s say, \u2018unorthodox\u2019 or write immediately that you\u2019re a Nazi or a far-right representative of the political spectrum.It\u2019s about migration but also it\u2019s about economic issues and others. So we\u2019ll see. We always respect the democratic will of the people. It should be like that if they vote for someone and they vote for a party, they have a good reason for it.One of the prominent politicians involved in the Patriotic Spring has been Austrian FP\u00d6 candidate for president Norbert Hofer. \u00a0Hofer recently visited\u00a0the Czech president in Prague and both expressed a desire for Austria to join the Visegrad 4 group who have shown solidarity against the mass migration policies of Western leaders like Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel.On Austrian membership into the group, Kov\u00e1cs\u00a0said:Austria has always rather belonged to Central Europe, not the Western part of Europe. With the facts and the consequences of what is happening on the southern and eastern borders of Europe now with migration, it would be an interesting turn and development if the Austrians realised that.We see it in that political campaign in Austria with the presidential elections, but we also see it in the Foreign Minister who has been very outspoken on migration issues and [is] fair and understanding about the perspectives of the Central European countries that Hungary represents for obvious reasons.They have the legacy, they have the political knowledge of why you should listen to Central Europe.The Hungarian government Mr.\u00a0Kov\u00e1cs represents has been one of the most forthright in Europe during the migrant crisis, offering its people a referendum on whether they wanted European Union-forced mass migration \u2014 98 per cent did not \u2014 and\u00a0proving building walls can reduce illegal migration. After Hungary\u2019s southern border fence was completed in 2015 illegal incursions into the nation dropped from tens of thousands daily to just a few dozen overnight.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, hungary, Patriot spring, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1csComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Euroscepticism is caused by different EU policies and there is no magic bullet to cure it.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front, is on the march. She is an elected MEP who led her party to victory in the 2014 European Parliament elections with almost 25% of the vote. Even more worryingly forthe European Union, it\u2019s likely she will gain enough votes to be included in the French Presidential run-off. It is possible she could be the French President next year.Le Pen\u2019s flagship policy is a French in-out referendum in which she will campaign to \u2018Leave\u2019 the EU. The overwhelming concern in France is immigration, caused by the EU\u2019s borderless Schengen Area and freedom of movement \u2013 and the opinion polls are telling.Over 60% of French people view the EU negatively and \u2018Leave\u2019 trails \u2018Remain\u2019 by only around 12%.In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders from the populist-right Freedom Party is calling for an EU referendum. His party is currently ahead in the opinion polls on 22%, but is likely to be kept out of any future coalition by mainstream parties who refuse to work with him.As with France, in the Netherlands immigration is the contentious EU issue. They have a history of Euroscepticism too, famously voting against the EU\u2019s Constitutional Treaty and recently against the EU\u2019s deal with Ukraine.It is also important to remember, the Netherlands has close trading links with the UK, favouring a free trade approach. If the EU attempts to roll back on any free trade approach once the UK leaves the bloc and erects barriers against UK trade, they will make so-called \u2018Nexit\u2019 far more likely.One of the EU\u2019s most disastrous policies has been the Euro currency. We are therefore obliged to mention Greece. In 2016 over 61% of Greek voters rejected the bailout package they were offered, but it was forced on them anyway.Membership of the Euro allowed Greece to borrow money too cheaply creating a bubble fuelled by mass debt, without a central bank to facilitate a competitive devolution. The Greek economy collapsed, condemning future generations to poverty. Greece is only a charismatic Eurosceptic leader away from an EU exit.Germany is often considered one of the most pro-EU countries, however Euroscepticism is even on the rise here. Next year Germany\u2019s Eurosceptic AfD Party are almost certain to have seats in the German Parliament after defeating Merkel\u2019s party in recent regional elections.The continual Greek bailouts and the weakness of the Schengen Area are causing tension. However, a vote to leave could only occur if Germany\u2019s contributions to the EU and its currency become unsustainable, combined with its influence being steadily diminished.Denmark is another country with a growing Eurosceptic party. The right-wing Danish People\u2019s Party, and even left-wing parties are calling for a referendum. EU support is still strong and increasing in the wake of Brexit. However, 40% want a referendum, and if Britain makes a success of it then Danish opinion may change.Finish Eurosceptics forced a debate in Parliament about leaving the Euro currency after receiving over 50,000 signatures. The Eurosceptic Finns Party is a member of the coalition government after coming second in the 2015 election.Whereas the Finns Party is Eurosceptic, it does not advocate EU withdrawal. Instead, it argues for renegotiation and a referendum. Their view in an EU referendum is likely to depend on how Britain fares and the amount of immigration reform on offer, as this is their number one issue.The Swedish Democrats are calling for Sweden to exit the EU and the Left Party are also calling for a referendum. They have 49 seats in the Swedish Parliament and echo the concerns of the Swedish people over immigration. Fortunately, Sweden did not adopt the Euro after rejecting it in a referendum.Sweden has strong trading links with the UK and any future Swedish referendum is likely to depend on whether the UK makes Brexit work.A Spanish exit is highly unlikely, but a Catalonia one is not. Independence for Catalonia is a very popular view, with separatists in charge of the regional government. They are wealthy enough to go it alone and had a referendum in 2014 where over 80% voted for independence, a result which is not recognised by Spain. If the Catalans declare independence from Spain, they would be forced under EU rules to leave the EU too.Hungary has deep anti-immigration sentiment, with nearly 98% of those taking part in its recent referendum voting against the EU\u2019s migrant quotas. The referendum was not valid due to turnout, but this has sent a strong message to Brussels. This, however, is more of an attempt to increase influence within the EU, rather than signalling a willingness to leave.The Eurozone\u2019s problems and immigration dominate the Italian news agenda. The Five Star Movement want to leave the Euro and reject the EU\u2019s increasing influence in Italy\u2019s affairs. They are currently leading the opinion polls and will be a major player in any future Italian election. 44% of Italians want an EU referendum. Further Eurozone problems could also pave the way for their exit.Euroscepticism is here to stay. The EU must change or collapse. We at Get Britain Out are positive the EU is incapable of change, and therefore collapse is inevitable.Matthew Ellery is a Research Executive at Get Britain OutBreitbart London, Immigration, Brexit, EU referendum, Frange, Germany, Greece, hungary, Netherlands, SwedenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The one that I heard was a song about white power and this kept going on and on. It was very loud and distinctive.\u201dA permit for the event was required from East Cambridgeshire District Council, and an application was lodged for a \u201cprivate party with music.\u201d During the application process Cambridgeshire Constabulary was consulted as to whether they had any objections. They said they had none as the organiser claimed the event was being held in support of Help for Heroes.Yet Cambridgeshire police spokesman has now told Cambridge News: \u201cThere was a three day music event held the weekend before last in a private field near Haddenham with the owner\u2019s permission. We had been in contact with other forces about similar events and were aware of a possible right wing element.\u201cSenior officers planned and implemented a response proportionate to the risk.\u201cWe worked with organisers and landowner and the event took place without any disorder or crime committed.\u201dHelp for Heroes, which works on behalf of injured soldiers and their families, denied any connection to the event, adding that they would not accept donations from extremist groups.The Campaign Against Antisemitism has questioned why the Police force allowed the event to go ahead if they believed it had a connection to extremism, and why no charges are being brought against the group despite video evidence of clear anti-Semitism emerging from the rally.A spokesman for the Campaign said: \u201cCambridgeshire Constabulary say they knew that this event was organised by the far-right but they also say they thought it was a charity event for Help for Heroes. They say they knew that Nazi salutes and anti-Semitic singing took place, but that no crime was committed.\u201cIt is staggering that in 2016 in Britain a police force is allowing neo-Nazi from a group banned across Europe to enter our country, use it as a haven for fascism, rally against Jews and then claim that no part of that was unlawful. We are lodging a formal complaint\u00a0and expect the conduct of the police officers concerned to be investigated, and the neo-Nazi perpetrators identifiable from the video footage to be prosecuted for their crimes.\u201dThe footage suggests the group may have broken laws including\u00a0section 29B\u00a0of the Public Order Act 1986 which states: \u201cA person who uses threatening words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, is guilty of an offence if he intends thereby to stir up religious hatred.\u201dThe maximum penalty, after a trial in the Crown Court, is seven years\u2019 imprisonment. Incitement to racial hatred and acts likely to stir up racial hatred are also illegal.Cambridgeshire Police came under severe criticism in August of this year when a number of its officers threatened the leader of PEGIDA UK, Tommy Robinson, with criminal charges unless he removed himself and his three young children, all under the age of ten, from the city of Cambridge immediately.The family was at a pub with friends following attendance at a football match when the incident happened. Robinson reported that his children were all visibly upset by the presence of the officers, who followed them over a mile and a half to the train station.Watch: Video reportedly captured at the eventBreitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, anti-semitism, British police, Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Campaign Against Antisemitism, Neo-Nazis, Tommy RobinsonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Accusing Taseer of being an apostate, the booklet adds that being a \u201cbig shot\u201d does not excuse someone from the punishment of death, the Evening Standard has reported.A worshipper at the mosque who was handed the booklet has told the paper: \u201cThe event was a few months ago. I took one, but other people took them as well.\u201cI think more than 100 people were at this event. It was at Giyarween Shareef [a holy gathering].\u201cTwo or three people delivered the leaflet.

Islam teaches when you live here you obey the law and the rule of law, but this is not doing that.\u201dThe booklet carries the name of the mosque\u2019s Imam, Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani, on its front cover along with a picture of him. According to the National Registry, Jilani co-owns the mosque with three others.The mosque is also home to the International Muslim Movement charity, for which Mr. Jilani is a trustee.In 2013, Jilani was at the centre of a controversy when Islamic station DM Digital was fined \u00a385,000\u00a0by Ofcom for broadcasting a sermon of his in which he reportedly said Muslims had a duty to kill those who insult Mohammed.However, he has denied having anything to do with the material, telling the Evening\u00a0Standard: \u201cI do not agree with the booklet\u2019s contents.

He reports that the episode is just the latest in a pattern of so-called humanitarian groups spreading false information to mobilise migrants.These organisations, Foldi argues, serve a dual purpose of promoting open borders activism as model behaviour. Depicted by the media as\u00a0humanitarians, and their actions pushed as being morally \u201ccorrect\u201d, he says this \u201chas an effect on the average citizen, who is taken in by it\u201d.The intelligence expert points out that spreading disinformation so as to rally crowds of migrants towards European borders is not actually a humanitarian thing to do, and more resembles a direct attack on state policy.He asks: \u201cBecause would it not be more humane for the people who arrived in Belgrade \u2014 illegally, I might add, without any travel documents and visas \u2014 to suggest that they visit the Hungarian consulate there and ask for a visa.\u201dQuestioning why a so-called humanitarian organisation would want to move migrant masses to the Hungarian border, Mr. Foldi says they are acting as part of a \u201cwell-established system, built years ago\u201d.\u201cWhat we seeing every day here is a fourth generation military operation against Europe. Not using traditional weaponry to enforce a strategy, but using economic and social infrastructure, and one element of that is the actions carried out by civilian humanitarian organisations,\u201d he explains.Mr. Foldi says Brussels directs \u201cformal political attacks\u201d on his nation\u2019s migrant policies because they \u201cwant to kill off at the roots any rebellious attitude, which is represented by Hungary, against a strategy they planned well ahead\u201d.Stating that Brussels\u2019s goal \u201cis to convert Europe into a multicultural system, a system which is above nations\u201d, Mr. Foldi argues that the EU is forcefully attacking Hungary because the country has taken concrete action to protect itself from being forced into multiculturalism.He concludes: \u201cThis is well-coordinated; it is not separate that Brussels wants something, the MSM wants something, and the civilian organisations want something, too. But this is a very well-coordinated effort, where it is only that tasks are divided between the branches of the same attack force.\u201dHungary\u2019s Prime Minister Victor Orb\u00e1n last year slammed the role of so-called humanitarian bodies in mass migration to Europe.He stated: \u201cThis invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other by those [human rights] activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state. This Western mindset and this activist network are perhaps best represented by George Soros.\u201dHungarian billionaire George Soros has admitted involvement in the crisis which saw over a million migrants enter the continent last year.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, George Soros, hungary, serbian border, Victor OrbanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But we find it hard to recognise this reality and to respond by defending the Christian faith.\u201d\u201cMany people do not understand what Islam really is,\u201d he added. \u201cThey create these slogans: we all believe in the same God, we are all united by love and so on. It\u2019s not true.\u201dHe also said that modern Christians are often unwilling to proclaim their beliefs, and should not be afraid to convert people of other faiths.\u201cChristians have neglected a fundamental truth: there is only one Saviour of the world: Jesus Christ. We must not proselytize, imposing Christianity, but if we believe in Jesus it is our duty to bear witness.\u201cI think that this witness is not very strong, even in countries that were called Christian once upon a time, such as the European nations.\u201dCardinal Burke, who is regarded as a leading traditionalist within the Catholic Church, went on to say that Islam poses a threat to the Western order because it makes no distinction between religion and the state.\u201cIslam is a threat in the sense that for the true Muslim, Allah must rule the world. Christ said in the Gospel: \u2018Render unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s\u2019. By contrast, the Islamic religion which is based on the law of the Koran aims to govern all countries where there are Muslims.\u201cWhile they are the minority they cannot insist, but when they become the majority they must apply the Sharia.\u201dWe can already see this in some Muslim-majority neighbourhoods, the cardinal added.\u201cToday there are enclaves, entire neighbourhoods, in Europe where there is in fact Muslim rule.\u201dSpeaking about so-called \u201cno-go zones\u201d such as Molenbeek, Cardinal Burke said that the existence of such neighbourhoods represented a failure of integration, calling them \u201ca state within a state\u201d.\u201cThe problem is that Muslims aim for expansion,\u201d he added. \u201cThe whole history of the Islamic presence in Europe is an attempt to conquer it.\u201dRather than through arms, that expansion will come through immigration and high birth rate.\u201cSeveral times I have heard Islamists explaining: \u2018What we failed to do with weapons in the past, we are doing today with birth rate and immigration.\u2019 The population is changing. If this keeps up, in countries like Italy, the majority will be Muslim.\u201dHowever, the blame for all this lies squarely on the decline of Western society.\u201cAll this happens through the corruption of the West. There are not enough families. We supinely accept practices that are contrary to the natural law, such as abortion or so-called \u201cmarriage\u201d between persons of the same sex. It is proof that we are not strong enough in faith, and easy prey for conquest.\u201dBreitbart London, Faith, Cardinal Raymond Burke, Catholic ChurchComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Three Druze and 13 Yazidis were also resettled.This is despite Syria\u2019s Christian population before the war accounting for about ten per cent of the country\u2019s population \u2013 and widespread acknowledgement that the Christian population in Syria is suffering extreme persecution.Charity Open Doors, which works on behalf of persecuted Christians worldwide,\u00a0reports: \u201cIslamic State (IS) attacked 35 Christian villages in February 2015 alone, abducting over 250 people and driving 3,000 others from their homes; the militants later executed three Christian hostages. It is impossible to be a Christian in IS-controlled areas, and even in areas still controlled by the government, evangelism and conversion from Islam are illegal.\u201dIn April, the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry even went so far as to declare Islamic State as \u201cresponsible for genocide\u201d against Christians, Yazidis and other minority groups in the territories it controls.Despite the outflow of people from the region, there are still believed to be around 772,000 Christians remaining in the country, making up more than four per cent of the current population.Yet the UN Agency charged with overseeing aid operations in the region, the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has been accused of marginalising Christians and other minorities, both within refugee camps in the region, and through its resettlement programmes.According to Nina Shea, an international human rights lawyer with more than thirty years\u2019 experience behind her, the fault in the UNHCR lies at the very top.Writing for the Wall Street Journal, she recounted an exchange she had in December with the UN\u2019s then-high commissioner for refugees,\u00a0Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in which she inquired why so few Christians were being resettled abroad.\u201cThe replies \u2013 from a man poised to be the U.N\u2019s next secretary-general \u2013 were shocking and illuminating,\u201d she wrote.\u201cMr. Guterres said that generally Syria\u2019s Christians should not be resettled, because they are part of the \u201cDNA of the Middle East\u201d. He added that Lebanon\u2019s Christian president had asked him not to remove Christian refugees. Mr. Guterres thus appeared to be articulating what amounts to a religious-discrimination policy, for political ends.\u201dIn January, a report by the Catholic News\u00a0Service\u00a0on Christian refugees in Lebanon, where the majority of Syrian refugees are encamped, stated: \u201cExit options seem hopeless as refugees complain that the staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are not following up on their cases after an initial interview.\u201dThe outcome for Christians in the region is disastrous.Fearing persecution from Muslims within the refugee camps, and unsure of being resettled, many Christians are opting to stay away. Instead, they are seeking shelter in the homes of fellow Christians, even if it means sleeping 30 to a room, according to John Pontifex, head of information at\u00a0Aid to the Church in Need.He told Christian Today that the Home Office figures highlight \u201cthe degree to which Christians are being left out. They are unable to claim proper help or to seek asylum in the West.\u201cThis is a community of suffering that has just disappeared below the radar. It is a crying shame, and these figures point to the way the crisis facing Christians, Yazidis and other minority faiths has been completely overlooked.\u201dA Home Office spokesperson commented: \u201cThe UK has been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. We have committed to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees through our Vulnerable Persons Resettlement scheme over the course of this parliament \u2014 we are on track to achieve that and have already provided refuge to more than 2,800 under this route.\u201cWe are clear that the scheme will prioritise the most vulnerable refugees, which is why under the VPR scheme the UNHCR identifies refugees for resettlement using its established vulnerability criteria.\u201dBreitbart London, Faith, Antonio Guterres, Christian Refugees, Islamic State, Syria, UNHCR, YazidisComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

States could refuse to take people for a year \u2014 but only if they paid another country 250,000 euros per person to accommodate them.Slovakia and Hungary have also challenged at the European Court of Justice an earlier decision on a one-off relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers agreed last year, as Greece struggled to cope with the chaotic arrival of nearly a million people.Breitbart London, Europe Migrant Crisis, migrant quota, SlovakiaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Therefore in terms of that element of foreign policy: Trump.\u201dMr. Kov\u00e1cs was quick to note that he and his government in Hungary would not officially endorse either candidate as that it was neither their custom nor their policy to interfere in the elections of sovereign nations.\u201cBut no endorsement, it\u2019s too early and we\u2019ve never done anything like that,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cBefore an election, it would be most impolite to do anything like that as one of them will become one of our\u00a0most important allies and strategic partners around the globe.\u201dHowever, Kov\u00e1cs did intimate that he was not as keen on the past few years of the Obama administration\u2019s dealing with Hungary and the Central European region.\u201cMy first-hand experience, the experience of the government, [is that] the U.S. has lost interest, and probably with it, knowledge about the region.\u00a0Europe in general, but most certainly about Central Europe.\u201d\u201cKnowledge and understanding is really needed to re-engage and reinforce this partnership. I\u2019m being polite and diplomatic for obvious reasons here because again; from the Hungarian perspective, America was there, was helping us and is a major ally,\u201d he said.The Hungarian government spokesman alluded to the attitudes of both the Obama administration and Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton on their heavily anti-Russia stances. Ms. Clinton at her famous \u201calt-right\u201d speech declared\u00a0that Russian president Vladimir Putin was the mastermind behind the various populist and patriotic movements around the world.\u201cWe are grateful that we have received back our democracy and freedom, but we have surpassed the Cold War and it\u2019s not the Cold War anymore,\u201d Mr. Kov\u00e1cs\u00a0said.\u201cSo you have to rethink and in that respect there are lots of things that should be done, discussed, or re-discussed.

In a recent referendum, Mr. Orban held on the subject, 98 per cent of Hungarians said they didn\u2019t want the European Union to be able to force migrants on their country.2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart London, Donald Trump, Europe Migrant Crisis, hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1csComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It currently doesn\u2019t know where it goes from here in a post-referendum world. The MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to be doing for income in two years. There is no party leader. And so tensions are very much high at the moment inside the party and I\u2019m afraid it looks like it\u2019s spilled over into what I would describe as a very human event, a very regrettable event.\u201dKassam stated that having both exchanged text messages with Woolfe and spoken to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the telephone just before going on air, the events of yesterday are still uncertain.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a clear idea of what happened yet, whether it was punching or pushing. Steven is understood to have fallen into a bar or a glass railing,\u201d he disclosed.Noting that Farage has announced an investigation into the episode, Kassam said the party can learn and move forward when the facts are ascertained, and urged people to avoid speculating or attributing blame in the meantime.He said: \u201cLet\u2019s just wait till the facts come out, let\u2019s ascertain some facts, let\u2019s have an investigation, and then we can see how we can move positively forward as a party and avoid things like this in the future.\u201dThis week the Breitbart London editor in chief threw his own hat into the ring for the UKIP leadership. Kassam says that he is the best-placed candidate to carry on the legacy of Farage, who grew the party from being a little-known fringe group to winning the European Parliamentary elections in the UK in 2014.To continue Farage\u2019s good work, which culminated in four million votes for the party in the 2014 General Election, Kassam outlines his vision for the party as \u00a0\u201cgiving a voice to British people who had been left behind by the country\u2019s embrace of globalism in recent decades.\u201dBreitbart London, Breitbart TV, UKIP, CNN, Nigel Farage, raheem kassam, Steven Woolfe, UKIP leadership contestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Socialist politician also said he hoped a further 20,000 spouses of French citizens would be naturalised each year through marriage.Causeur reports that it is very much an \u201copen secret\u201d that in recent months the department which manages accession to French nationality has been \u201ca machine that is naturalising in full swing\u201d.Reportedly, naturalisations have risen at a rate far higher than in recent years. Between 2013 and 2015 the rate at which the decree was given increased by 17 per cent, whilst it had halved between 2010 and 2012 before Valls took office and modified the rules.In 2015 the department had more than met the Prime Minister\u2019s goal of 100,000, naturalising 113,603 people. Causeur discovered that the number of \u201cnew French\u201d this year could exceed last year\u2019s total by 45 per cent.The majority of people who are being granted citizenship are not European, accounting for 78 per cent of the total. Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians top the list of \u201cnew French\u201d, followed by Turks and Senegalese people.Causeur notes that applications for citizenship are received by the sub-directorate of access to French nationality of the Interior Ministry, where they are approved or refused, and then sent on to the central record keeping service which realises the process.The journal found that this service \u201chas a stock of 10,000 pending cases which have already been accepted by the Interior Ministry\u201d, something which Causeur states is \u201cextremely rare\u201d.With the presidential election set for next year, polls have for months shown president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande losing to all likely adversaries. According to a 2012 survey of 10,000 voters, 93 per cent of Muslims in France voted for the Socialist Party president, who is the most unpopular head of France in modern history.In his successful presidential campaign, Hollande promised an amnesty to all of the estimated 400,000 Muslims illegally in France.Now a huge, and growing, electoral bloc, commentators have observed that Muslims in France decided the election. An \u00a0estimated 1.7 million of them voted for Hollande in 2012, who beat incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy by just 1.1 million votes.Breitbart London, Faith, Immigration, France, France presidential election, Islam, Islam in France, manuel valls, Socialist Party FranceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

You remember the Labour\u00a0Party MP Eric Joyce, in 2012, had\u00a0this \u2013 you\u2019ve had members of the Conservative Party engaging in fisticuffs\u00a0in Parliament as well.\u201cThese things\u00a0can happen, it\u2019s a very human thing to happen when you don\u2019t have a leader, when\u00a0you don\u2019t necessarily have a raison d\u2019\u00eatre, when things\u00a0are a little bit in existential crisis, then\u00a0passions can overflow.\u201d\u201cI think both of these two men, again to echo\u00a0what Michael [Hookem, the other party in the altercation] said we don\u2019t know\u00a0truly what happened, but I think both of these two men will look back on this and think\u00a0\u2018that did not reflect well on me or\u00a0my party\u2019.\u201dIn-fighting broke out again following the incident after Neil Hamilton, the leader of UKIP\u00a0in the Welsh Assembly, told BBC News that Mr. Woolfe had \u201cpicked a fight [\u2026] and came off worse.\u201dIn response, major party donor Arron Banks issued a statement threatening to leave the party \u201cIf Neil Hamilton and [UKIP MP] Douglas Carswell remain in the party, and the NEC [National Executive Committee] decide that Steven Woolfe can not run for leader.\u201dMr. Banks called for new elections to the NEC as well as for leader, adding: \u201cit is clear that we ourselves, are at breaking point.\u201dKassam told Snow that he could \u201csympathise\u201d with Banks\u2019 position, saying: \u201cwhen Neil Hamilton uses this incident \u2013 while Steven Woolfe is laying in a hospital \u2013 to attack the party leader, to attack different figures in the party, this is the exact problem we\u2019re talking about.\u201dBut he added that he did not sympathise with the tone Banks had employed in his statement, calling for more reconciliatory action all round.\u201cIf\u00a0today has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we\u00a0need to take a step back, we need to reflect very\u00a0seriously not just on this incident and what it means, but we need to reflect on who we are as a political party, what\u00a0we are as a movement, what we stand for, what we\u2019re going to do going forward, and start positively campaigning on those issues remembering we\u2019re all on the same side,\u201d he said.He added firmly: \u201cThis is an open call to all UKippers out there: either get together or get lost.\u201dOn Sunday it emerged, via a new book, that Douglas Carswell had defected from the Conservatives in 2014 not because he shared UKIP\u2019s aims, but to infiltrate the party to \u201cneutralise\u201d leader Nigel Farage. The revelation confirmed suspicions that many, including Kassam, had had about his motives.Last night Kassam was unequivocal in setting out his solution for the party infighting, saying: \u201cIf you do want to solve this problem then you have to say to the people who aren\u2019t Ukippers through and through, who have done things that are completely contrary to what the party has stood for for so long, you have to say to them: \u2018Thank you for being in this party, but I\u2019m afraid your services are no longer required.\u2019\u201dQuestions as to whether UKIP still has a purpose now that the Conservative Party is actively working towards taking Britain out of the European Union, Kassam said it does, namely: to represent working class interests.\u201c[L]ook at the party\u2019s manifesto from 2015, how much it has influenced the government on issues like grammar schools,\u201d he said.\u201cUKIP may well have been a single issue party once upon a time, it is not a single issue party any more, and it actually represents people way across the country who feel that they can\u2019t vote for the Conservative Party and they can\u2019t vote for the Labour Party because they\u2019ve been left behind by Conservative and Labour governments. UKIP does have a serious raison d\u2019\u00eatre, we need to find it and project it\u201d.Breitbart London, Breitbart TV, UKIP, douglas carswell, raheem kassam, Steven Woolfe, ukipComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Williams, Ph.D.7 Oct 20160On Thursday, a Spanish Civil Guard ship carrying 1258 migrants rescued off the coast of Libya landed at Cagliari, on the Italian island of Sardinia. After a two-day sea journey, the vessel Rio Segura was told that all the migrant shelters are full and therefore the migrants would have to remain aboard the ship until provisions could be made for their housing.A new procedure of migrant identification and registration has been instituted according to which photo identification would take place before migrants will be permitted to descend from rescue vessels. The situation in Sardinia is so serious that the Cagliari Civil Defense has been using the terminal intended for cruise ships as the identification center for the first reception of migrants.\u201cThe operation could go on for three or four days,\u201d said the commissioner Danilo Gagliardi. \u201cThe structure will remain in operation until we can identify all as required under the new ministerial directive.\u201dOfficials say that all the welcome centers and refugee shelters in Sardinia\u2019s four provinces are completely full and can accept no more migrants until some of the present occupants are relocated.\u201cThe situation is deteriorating,\u201d says Omar Zahed, spokesman for the Islamic community of Sardinia. \u201cThe reception is improvised. It is not possible that when refugees arrive here there is still no plan what to do with them. Unfortunately, we cannot stop the flow, it is time that we organize for the long term.\u201dItaly has been particularly hard hit this week by the arrival of thousands of migrants. Between Monday and Tuesday, a record number of over ten thousand mostly African migrants were rescued in the Strait of Sicily and brought to Italy, bringing the year\u2019s total to over 142,000.The Italian Coast Guard coordinated dozens of\u00a0rescue\u00a0missions off the coast of Libya in the two days, recovered over 6,000 migrants on Monday in one of the largest single-day operations of the European migration crisis, and then another 4,655 on Tuesday.Federico Soda, Director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Office in Rome, said that among the migrants arriving in Italy there has been a noted increase in West African nationalities. \u201cOften these are people who leave their country of origin without a specific destination. Libya is where many are smuggled to and the majority of migrants there face extreme violence and abuse. Some, scared for their lives, decide to continue their journey to Europe,\u201d he said.According to the IOM, the Channel of Sicily is currently the deadliest border in the world: 3,610 people died while crossing the Mediterranean in 2016 and out of these, 3,134 died trying to reach Italy.Follow Thomas D.

He claims that officers in Germany are putting themselves at constant risk as many of the migrants are known to have a high level of violent\u00a0behaviour\u00a0and attack police who attempt to arrest them.\u201cIf there is no pre-trial detention made, no imprisonment is imposed, and no deportations carried out then the police make multiple arrests and the perpetrators get away with it,\u201d he said and\u00a0maintained\u00a0that the migrants end up back on the streets.Mr. Wendt cited the \u201cCasablanca Report\u201d which documented some 2,244 North African migrant criminals in the city of Dusseldorf.\u00a0According\u00a0to the police union chief, the numbers for other major German cities are similar and he said that the migrant crisis has only served to reinforce numbers in the already-existing migrant criminal gangs.Last year, Mr. Wendt made a similar statement at the height of the migrant crisis. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect our law,\u201d he said and asked\u00a0why \u201cthings always have to go up in flames\u201d before politicians \u201creact\u201d.Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said that the\u00a0government\u00a0of Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel forecasts a massive increase in migrants from Africa.\u201cThe migration pressure will increase dramatically in the coming years if we do not manage to create economic opportunities in African countries,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwhat happens there has a direct impact on Europe\u201d.The findings match a report from the European Union border agency Frontex who earlier this year reported that the future of the migrant crisis was young migrant men coming from Africa to Europe for better economic opportunities rather than legitimate refugees fleeing conflict\u00a0or persecution.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany asylum seekers, Migrant Crime, Rainer WendtComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The protest had come at a time of heightened tensions between the people of Calais and migrants living in the nearby Jungle camp, which had led to a ban on demonstrations in the town.Official portrait of General Christian Piquemal as commander of the French Foreign Legion / http://en.legion-etrangere.com/Ignoring the prohibition, the General addressed the crowd leading to his arrest \u2013 an event which led to uproar in France as the Foreign Legion is highly regarded among French patriots.However, a later court hearing cleared the General of involvement in the organisation of the meeting, and the General thought that was the end of the matter.Yet in September he received a letter from the military informing him that he was no longer to consider himself an active part of the military, it has now emerged.It appears that at a\u00a0meeting of the High Council of the Army held in June, Army officials advised the Ministry of Defence to strip him of his office without informing the General or his lawyers of the proceedings being held against him. The President, Prime Minister, and Defence Ministers, however, were informed.\u201cI\u2019m deeply shocked by this unfair and unjustified decision, which seems to me to be excessive and disproportionate,\u201d the General told Le Figaro.The sanctions are \u201ctotally detached from the reality of my acquittal, offending every measure of decency,\u201d the General said.Although the General\u2019s rank cannot be withdrawn, he has been banned from wearing his uniform or using his Military ID, which in principle are granted for life. In addition, he has lost his reserve list status.It is these sanctions, which represent a return to civilian life, which \u201churt the most\u201d, the General said, rather than the financial penalties which will result from the sanction.\u201cI find it unacceptable that I can be ostracised in this way after giving forty years in the service of France.

If it does not comply with political correctness, then it is sanctioned.\u201cThe truth is that my case is an instrument to silence the Grande Muette [a French expression meaning the silent voice of the military]\u00a0because other generals have expressed more controversial expressions before.\u00a0They want to make me an example to silence the ranks.\u201dBreitbart London, Immigration, Calais, Europe Migrant Crisis, France, Islam in France, military, PEGIDAComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The court on Thursday raised the possibility of bringing criminal charges against the Catalan parliament\u2019s speaker for allowing the vote.Catalonia\u2019s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, said last Wednesday that he was open to negotiating the terms of a legally binding referendum but he would hold it with or without Spain\u00b4s blessing.Puigdemont comfortably won a parliamentary confidence vote last Thursday in a show of unity that he hoped would spur further support for his independence agenda, which aims to establish basic laws and a state structure by next September.Some 48 percent of Catalans supported secession in a poll in July, although that it is below its peak from a few years ago.Breitbart London, Catalonia, catalonian independence, SpainComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The centre has already received more than 1,500 items of luggage.While the closure of the southern part of the \u2018Jungle\u2019 in March provoked fierce clashes between riot police and the migrants, news of this final shutdown has not, for the moment at least, generated the same level of resistance.Salome said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want this shanty town to go on. Now there\u2019s a chance for the migrants who stay in France to be better off.\u201dBut special arrangements will have to be made for the children at the site.French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said this week there were up to 950 children living in the \u2018Jungle\u2019, many unaccompanied.Campaigners also say that many of the children have family in Britain and should be allowed to travel there.Breitbart London, Calais, jungleComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Hungary has not experienced the same wave of crime linked to mass-migration that other European nations have, and has not been a target for terror attacks.Hungarian police are presently hunting the suspect, seen carrying a rucksack which is believed to have contained explosives, before the blast which injured two and damaged nearby buildings.Despite that, the nature of potential future terror attacks the Hungarian government anticipated was clear from the exercise. Attacking a bus and metro interchange, the police actors playing terrorists carried AK-style rifles, attempted to behead civilians, and can be heard shouting \u201cAllahu Akhbar\u201d in the Hungarian government\u2019s promotional video.On a personal note the Hungarian leader remarked as the exercise came to a close ad he addressed the police officers who took part: \u201cI wish you every success and good health.

It also suggested that online hate speech \u201ctargeting Muslims in particular has soared\u201d over the last three years.The ECRI, based in Strasbourg, France, is a human rights panel of the Council of Europe, an international organisation of 47 member states dedicated to promoting human rights and the rule of law within Europe.In its recommendations, drawn up following a visit to the UK in November 2015, the ECRI suggested the British press be regulated to prevent it from publishing anything considered to be hate speech via the introduction of a press regulator.It singled out the press\u2019s coverage of Islamic terrorist incidents for particular censure, suggesting that media outlets refrain from reporting the Islamic motives of terrorist attacks to avoid a \u201cbacklash\u201d against Muslims.In the report, the Commission said: \u201cECRI considers that, in light of the fact that Muslims are increasingly under the spotlight as a result of recent ISIS-related terrorist acts around the world, fuelling prejudice against Muslims shows a reckless disregard, not only for the dignity of the great majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom, but also for their safety.\u201cIn this context, it draws attention to a recent study by Teeside University suggesting that where the media stress the Muslim background of perpetrators of terrorist acts, and devote significant coverage to it, the violent backlash against Muslims is likely to be greater than in cases where the perpetrators\u2019 motivation is downplayed or rejected in favour of alternative explanations.\u201dPoliticians including the former Prime Minister David Cameron and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage also came in for criticism for their rhetoric on migration.\u201cThere continues to be considerable intolerant political discourse, coming from the populist anti-migrant UK Independence Party (UKIP) as well as other political actors,\u201d the report said, pointing to UKIP\u2019s warning on extending open borders to Romania and Bulgaria as evidence.Farage is singled out for contributing to a \u201cclimate of mistrust and fear of Muslims\u201d thanks to his warning that \u201cthere is rising public concern about immigration partly because people believe there are some Muslims who want to form a fifth column and kill us\u201d.Meanwhile, Cameron is slammed for using the word \u201cswarm\u201d in relation to attempts by illegal migrants in Calais to storm the channel tunnel repeatedly last summer.\u201cIt is no coincidence that racist violence is on the rise in the UK at the same time as we see worrying examples of intolerance and hate speech in the newspapers, online and even among politicians,\u201d said ECRI Chair Christian Ahlund.\u201cThe Brexit referendum seems to have led to a further rise in \u2018anti-foreigner\u2019 sentiment, making it even more important that the British authorities take the steps outlined in our report as a matter of priority.\u201dThe wide-ranging report makes a total of 23 recommendations, including that \u201cthe authorities should \u2026 establish a real dialogue with Muslims in order to combat Islamophobia and consult them on all policies which could affect Muslims,\u201d and that reporters should be given \u201cmore rigorous training\u201d by the government.Northern Ireland was also criticised for failing to introduce legislation legalising gay marriage, an apparent oversight which the Commission said ought to be remedied.But the British government has dismissed suggestions that it add another layer of press regulation on top of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), set up in 2014.In a written statement to the ECRI, it said: \u201cThe Government is committed to a free and open press and does not interfere with what the press does and does not publish, as long as the press abides by the law.\u201dBreitbart London, Council Of Europe, David Cameron, islamic terrorism, Islamophobia, Nigel Farage, press regulationComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The term \u201cVolkisch\u201d relates to the German interpretation of populism and carries connotations of folksy and organic living.Introducing Volkisch families, the daily newspaper writes: \u201cThey belong to no party, no union, and no organisation. They have no [political] voice and get no handouts. The term therefore [refers to] family groups who live in the countryside and are outwardly exemplary but internally right-wing.\u201dDescribing a scene in which men, women, and children in traditional dress dance around a meadow, the newspaper warns that while such people look \u201cbasically quite harmless, they are not\u201d.Volkische families, Welt informs readers, are \u201cfriendly neighbours\u201d who \u201cgrow vegetables and raise animals, keep bees, and produce electricity from photovoltaic systems\u201d.Other indicators to watch out for, it continues, are people who \u201cshow up as \u2018greenies\u2019 and engage in agriculture and crafts, argue against the planned highway 39 in their region, and they have a lot of children.

The former vice president, a climate activist, will speak about not just Clinton\u2019s plan to address global warming, but also the idea that voting for an independent presidential candidate could deliver the White House to Republicans in the same way that Ralph Nader\u2019s candidacy helped undermine his presidential bid in 2000.Well, perhaps. An alternative possibility is that Gore\u2019s intervention will focus voters\u2019 attention on one of\u00a0Hillary\u2019s biggest weaknesses: her dedication to an anti-science, anti-human, anti-free-markets ideology which, in defiance of reason or evidence, seeks to hamstring\u00a0U.S. industry and punish consumers in the name of dealing with a non-existent problem.Make no mistake, environmentalism is one of the clearest and most important points of difference between the two main presidential candidates.Under a Hillary presidency, green crony capitalism will\u00a0flourish: the corrupt, meddling, dishonest Environmental Protection Agency will grow more powerful and intrusive; activist groups like the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy will grow more shrill and demanding in their war on freedom and property rights; fossil fuel producers (coal especially) will be punished while more taxpayers\u2019 money will be squandered on subsidising bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes and other \u201cclean energy\u201d ventures; regulations on everything from zoning to agricultural land-use to clean air will grow more stringent; enviro-capitalist cronies like Tom Steyer will be enriched; energy intensive industries will be punished; consumers will be hit in the pocket.Under a Trump presidency, the green blob will be slain causing massive \u2013 but necessary \u2013 stock market disruption as the entire, Enron-inspired green Ponzi scheme unravels and the Augean stables containing three or four decades\u2019 worth of environmentalist ordure are finally swept clean.Which, of course, is one reason why the liberal media \u2013 which for years has been unquestioningly pushing the green narrative without doing any due diligence as to its accuracy \u2013 is having such conniptions at the prospect of a Trump victory. According to this WaPo editorial, Trump will cue the arrival of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, at the very least.It took\u00a0global negotiators a quarter-century to strike the Paris climate agreement, an international accord aimed at slowing global warming. The agreement represents the best hope for a world in which no one country acting alone can do enough to fight this global threat. Donald Trump could destroy the agreement with a stroke of a pen, and with it any hope that the world will keep the planet\u2019s temperature within the boundaries scientists say are safe.The Paris deal represents a major U.S. commitment, but it is not a treaty with the force of law. President Obama submitted the U.S. emissions goal; Mr. Trump could withdraw it just as easily. He also could deeply undercut or eliminate the basis for any future U.S. commitment. Mr. Trump has promised to rescind the Clean Power Plan, which obliges electrical utilities to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by cutting down on coal burning and increasing their use of natural gas and renewables. The Environmental Protection Agency drew up the plan using authorities that Congress gave it decades ago in the Clean Air Act. Mr. Trump could press the agency to revoke it or water it down.Mr. Trump also would have considerable sway over the state of the nation\u2019s land and water. He has promised\u00a0to use that power to quash regulations on drilling and to open federal lands to coal, oil and gas production. He could do more; for example, he could attempt to use executive discretion over drilling royalties, pipeline construction, permitting, drilling leases, oil and gas exports, and other matters to reward firms and people he likes or to punish those he does not.All this is true, but in a good way.\u00a0Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, though it would largely be a symbolic gesture because the agreement is not legally binding and therefore meaningless, would represent a bravura act of trolling; but rescinding the Clean Power Plan would cut costs to business and benefit consumers, while opening up federal lands to the oil and\u00a0gas industries would drastically increase the fracking boom which has brought America prosperity and increased energy independence.Those who worry about the environmental costs should be aware that the EPA\u2019s clean air policies are a) based on the junkiest of rigged junk science\u00a0and b) that the difference it makes to \u201cglobal warming\u201d \u2013 if any \u2013 will be immeasurably small. By the end of the century, Bjorn Lomborg has calculated, America\u2019s Clean Power Plan will reduce the world\u2019s increase in temperatures by a spectacular 0.004 degrees C.

Instead of gambling with their future, Liam Fox and his government colleagues should do the decent thing and give assurances to all EU nationals living here that they will have the right to stay.\u201dLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron similarly said: \u201cPeople who have made their home here, paid taxes and contributed to our society must be able to stay, no ifs and no buts.\u201cThese are people\u2019s neighbours, colleagues and spouses, they must not be treated as political bargaining chips.\u201dBreitbart London, Immigration, Brexit, conservative party conference, EU citizens, liam foxComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He contends: \u201cGiven the aging population in Europe, the benefits [of migration] significantly outweigh the associated problems and the cost of integrating migrants.\u201dDespite maintaining that migrants are a boon to European economies, Soros says the EU should create spend \u201cat least \u20ac30 billion annually\u201d on facilitating the migration of non-Europeans. The globalist billionaire has frequently championed the idea that EU nations should borrow large amounts of money to fund mass migration.Although Soros claims mass migration of unskilled migrants from poor countries would benefit European economies, facts suggest they are a serious drain on EU states\u2019 resources. Non-EU migrants cost the UK treasury \u00a316 billion a year, net, while across the continent they have more than double the unemployment rates of Europeans.A variety of datasets from different European countries support the idea that non-European migrants are a net cost to nations\u2019 treasuries. In the Netherlands, 65 per cent of non-European migrants who arrived during the 1990s are still living on welfare.That\u00a0aging populations should be offset by the mass importation of migrants has been described as a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d by Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of research at the Centre for Migration Studies. He argues that GDP growth driven by mass migration boosts companies\u2019 profits at the expense of quality of life and the environment.The demographer ,who directed the United Nations Population Division for 12 years, notes that mass migration means more demand, consumption, borrowing, and profits, but explains that the system is unsustainable.He writes: \u201cWhen the bubble eventually bursts and the economy sours, the scheme spirals downward with higher unemployment, depressed wages, falling incomes, more people sinking into debt, more homeless families \u2014 and more men, women and children on public assistance.\u201dDr. Chamie contends that Ponzi demography allows companies to enjoy the increased profits brought about by a larger population while the general public, through taxation, is forced to pick up the tab for mounting costs of education, healthcare, housing, and crime.Breitbart London, Immigration, EU migration, Europe Migrant Crisis, Europe open borders, George Soros, Germany MigrantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Ending this will be one of the key tasks for the government as it negotiates a Brexit deal.Breitbart London, Brexit, Brexit negotiationsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

They find the fact that more than seventeen million people voted to leave the European Union simply bewildering.\u201cBecause if you\u2019re well off and comfortable, Britain is a different country and these concerns are not your concerns.\u201dThe vote, she said, had been a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d in which \u201cmillions of our fellow citizens had stood up and said they were not prepared to be ignored anymore\u201d.In an excoriating attack on the Labour Party, she insisted it doesn\u2019t have the monopoly on \u201ccompassion\u201d or on \u201cmoral superiority\u201d, and that her government would \u201cstep up \u2013 and not back \u2013 to act on behalf of the people\u201d.However, in comments which will anger the libertarian right of her party, May laid out a centrist vision of a government which actively involves itself in the improvement of living standards.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to dismiss [the concerns of working class people], she continued. \u201cEasy to say that all you want from government is for it to get out of the way. But a change has got to come. It\u2019s time to remember the good that government can do.\u201cTime for a new approach that says while government doesn\u2019t have all the answers, government can and should be a force for good; that the state exists to provide what individual people, communities, and markets cannot; and we should employ the power of government for the good of the people.\u201cTime to reject the ideological templates provided by the socialist left and the libertarian right and to embrace a new centre-ground in which government steps up \u2013 and not back \u2013 to act on behalf of us all.\u201dLaying out her vision for government, she described it as: \u201cSupporting free markets, but stepping in to repair them when they aren\u2019t working as they should. Encouraging business and supporting free trade, but not accepting one set of rules for some and another for everyone else.\u201dIn that vein, May pledged to \u201c[provide] security from crime, but from ill health and unemployment too\u201d.In a perceived slight of the Cameron-led Conservative administration, she added: \u201cAnd if we do [succeed] \u2013 if we act to correct unfairness and injustice and put government at the service of ordinary working people \u2013 we can build that new united Britain in which everyone plays by the same rules, and in which the powerful and the privileged no longer ignore the interests of the people.\u201dThe speech has been welcomed by Conservative organisations, including the Bow Group who\u2019s chair Ben Harris-Quinney said he applauded May\u2019s \u201creturn to clear conservative principles\u201d.But May was not without her critics.The former Labour leader Ed Miliband has slammed as \u201cMarxist\u201d her plans to regulate energy prices by introducing price controls, tweeting that they were \u201canti-business interventionism\u201d:Marxist, anti-business interventionism imho https://t.co/xPzn61iqTk\u2014 Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) October 5, 2016Meanwhile the right-wing blogger Guido Fawkes has criticised her claim to be \u201creject[ing] ideological templates,\u201d pointing out: \u201cMay is advocating an ideology of \u2018centrism\u2019, statist, intervening\u00a0in the economy, acceptance of perpetual borrowing and over-spending, coupled\u00a0with greater intrusion by the state into the lives of individuals.\u201dBreitbart London, Brexit, Conservative Party, immigration, libertarianism, Theresa May, white working class votersComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In reaction, a number of the Italian media and politicians are decrying what they term an \u201cinvasion\u201d of illegal immigrants into Italy.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), from the start of 2016 through October 1, the number of new migrants into Italy had reached 132,069. On Monday, 6,055 more migrants were rescued at sea and 4,655 more were added to that number on Tuesday, bringing the total to 142,779.Along with the rescued survivors, 38 corpses were also recovered from the sea during the two days, including a 23-year-old pregnant woman. So far this year, more than 3,500 have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean.Monday marked the third anniversary to the day of a watershed moment in Europe\u2019s migrant crisis, which brought the situation to the world stage.

The CDU politician\u2019s office was previously trashed by criminals in August.Ms. Kudla recently came under fire for using the word \u201cUmvolkung\u201d, a term critics linked to Nazi Germany. Meaning \u201cethnicity inversion\u201d, it refers to the forced ethnic transformation of a population and has recently been used by right wingers criticising mass migration.The statement posted on Indymedia, which claims\u00a0responsibility for the attack, slams the idea of a demographic transformation of Germany as \u201ca myth\u201d. It was revealed last month that 40 per cent of children under 5 in Germany now have a migrant background.The post argues that by discussing the concept of population replacement, Ms Kudla is \u201cproviding legitimacy to the murderous thirst of fascists on the streets\u201d.It criticises the centre-right CDU and the centre-left Social Democratic Party for tightening asylum rules and blamed them for \u201cmass murder in the Mediterranean\u201d, presumably referring to migrants who have drowned illegally trying to enter Europe.The post also slams German Unity Day celebrations for \u201ccelebrating the myth that\u2026 racists and neo-Nazis don\u2019t belong to Europe\u201d. Claiming that Germans are responsible for migrant deaths and \u201cthe impoverishment of Europe\u201d its anonymous authors warn, \u201cfor that, they will always have to pay the price\u201d.The vandalism comes after a series of attacks on offices, vehicles and election posters of the anti-mass migration and eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, support for which has risen to double-digits.Earlier this year a study by the Berlin Senate\u2019s Department of Internal Affairs found that far-left activists are increasingly targeting individuals in their attacks, with strategies including subjecting conservative residents to abuse and physical assaults.Breitbart London, Alternative For Germany, CDU, far left, Germany, Germany Migrants, LeipzigComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Williams, Ph.D.4 Oct 20160While his younger sister, Tasleem, was sitting in their kitchen with their mother and sister, Mubeen Rajhu shot her in the head at their home in Lahore this past August.Eighteen-year-old Tasleem had married a Christian man named Jehangir, who even agreed to convert to Islam to please her family, but this wasn\u2019t sufficient to stop her brother from killing her.Rajhu now faces life in prison, but he has no regrets about the \u201chonor killing,\u201d which he claims was the right thing to do.\u201cI could not let it go. It was all I could think about. I had to kill her,\u201d Rajhu said matter-of-factly in a video interview released by the Associated Press. \u201cI had no choice.\u201dIn the interview, Rajhu said he faced increasing pressure from neighbors and coworkers to do something about his sister\u2019s situation.Other members of the Muslim community in Lahore expressed support for Rajhu\u2019s actions, suggesting his actions were the noble option.\u201cI am proud of this man that he has done the right thing, to kill her,\u201d one neighbor named Babar Ali said in the interview. \u201cWe cannot allow anyone to marry outside our religion. He did the right thing.\u201dTasleem\u2019s father Mohammed Naseer Rajhu blames his daughter for her own death, and for the disgrace she brought to the family.\u201cMy family is destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is destroyed only because of this shameful girl. Even after death I am destroyed because of her.\u201dAs Pamela Geller has observed, Tasleem\u2019s death restored honor to her family according to the Islamic code, which places honor killings in a different class from murder. The laws of many Muslim countries such as Jordan and Syria reflect this discrepancy, with significantly reduced penalties for honor killings as compared to other murders.Geller also noted that Muslims commit 91 percent of all honor killings worldwide, and even in the United States with its small Islamic population, 84 percent of honor killings are carried out by Muslims.Honor killings are on the rise in Pakistan, and the overwhelming majority of victims are women. According to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 1,184 people died from honor killings last year, only 88 of them men. In 2014, the number was 1,005, and the year before it was 869.Local Christians in Lahore say they are living in fear since Tasleem\u2019s death, and gunmen have already fired bullets into the homes of Christians living in the area.\u201cWe have been scared since the killing took place,\u201d one Christian said. \u201cThere are just a few houses of Christians here, but we have nowhere else to go.\u201dChristians are notoriously vulnerable in Pakistan, despite laws that guarantee their rights to religious freedom. Many Christians and other minorities have accused the government of doing little to protect them, as violence against Christians is rarely punished.Prejudice against Christians is inculcated at an early age in Pakistan, even in the country\u2019s schools.Earlier this year, a study on textbooks used in Pakistan\u2019s public schools found \u201cdeeply troubling content\u201d in the representation of Christians as fundamentally inferior to Muslims.The comprehensive\u00a0report,\u00a0Teaching Intolerance in Pakistan: Religious Bias in Public School Textbooks, found that the textbooks are used to confer \u201cpublic shaming\u201d on Christians and other minorities, indoctrinating schoolchildren with a pro-Muslim prejudice from the earliest ages.\u201cPublic shaming begins at a very young age,\u201d the report found, and the Pakistani curriculum teaches that religious minorities, particularly Christians and Hindus, are \u201cnefarious, violent, and tyrannical by nature.\u201dPakistan is overwhelmingly\u00a0Muslim, with Christians making up less than 2% of the population.Follow Thomas D.

He said:\u201cIt is therefore presumed there has been some form of agreement or consultation prior to the events, so that hundreds of men from the North African region should spend New Year\u2019s Eve 2015 around Cologne Central Station.\u201cWe suspect word of mouth in refugee camps or other residential accommodation, or to arrangements using social media such as Facebook or WhatsApp\u201d.While the psychologist said the predominantly North African migrants had arranged to congregate in great numbers on New Year\u2019s Eve, the majority hadn\u2019t gone with the express intention to rape and molest girls celebrating that night. Rather, when they saw local police were not doing anything about them engaging in other crimes, they become emboldened.Professor Egg likened this to the well-known \u201cbroken windows theory\u201d, where the threshold for offending drops when individuals realise they can be committed without repercussion. He said \u201cthis was exactly the case in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve\u201d.Criticism was focussed on the police response in the immediate aftermath of the New Year\u2019s Eve attacks which saw one child conceived by rape and 659 women recorded as victims of sexual assault.A police report said: \u201cThe women were in this case surrounded by the group of people and groped above their clothing, jewellery stolen and was snatched. In one case, a 19-year-old German victim had fingers inserted into her body openings [vagina and anus]\u201d.Yet shortly after the full details of the unprecedented assault began to emerge, it transpired the low numbers of police on duty were down to a decision by the state interior minister, who had denied a request for re-enforcements from his police chief.That police chief was then fired by interior minister Ralf Jager to restore public trust in the police. Later revelations showed how the interior ministry had ordered police to cover up the attacks by removing references to rape in their reports.\u00a0Breitbart London, Immigration, Law Enforcement, Cologne, Cologne sex assaults, Europe Migrant Crisis, GermanyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

There was a correlation between levels of education generally and a likelihood for voting for Brexit.\u201cWhich means there\u2019s a huge opportunity for universities to play the part they want to play in widening participation and ensuring that more people, particularly from disadvantaged background, get a chance to go to university and share in the benefits that higher education can bring.\u201dWhile Mr. Johnson\u2019s claims that more university graduates are more likely to be pro-EU are correct, his implication that this is the ideal scenario and therefore more people from poor backgrounds should be subjected to graduate-level EU propaganda will no doubt cause consternation amongst Brexiteers.According to the Telegraph, Johnson, who is the minister for higher education, delivered the comments just days after a new report stated that only \u201cAB\u201d voters \u2013 the middle and upper classes \u2013 voted in majority to remain in the European Union.The report also intimates are aiming to change lower class public opinion.Responding to comments, former teacher and UKIP member of the London Assembly David Kurten said: \u201cI am sure Mr Johnson would think that anyone who didn\u2019t go to Eton like his friends and fellow Remainers are uneducated.\u201cHowever, there are millions of people in this country who didn\u2019t benefit from a feather-bedded education as he did who are just as informed and wise as he is. How would he explain that his brother the Foreign Secretary an Old Etonian and an Oxford man decided that the wisest move policy is to be in control of your own destiny.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t need a Minister to say that it is imperative that our tertiary education sector must be accessible to all, from all parts of the country and from all backgrounds. But it must also be pointed out that shoveling people through universities in order to hit numbers targets also condemns millions to greater and greater debt for what is in certain cases a diminishing asset.\u201cIf our universities are to be respected by both students and the wider community both at home and abroad then the stack em high approach he is suggesting is not the way forward. We should recognise that there are many valuable modes of education, from universities, through degree apprenticeships, traditional apprenticeships, and others which have an equal if not greater value\u201d.Breitbart London, Brexit, Jo JohnsonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

More than 100 officers were involved in trying to settle the dispute between the two groups and a police helicopter monitored the situation from the air, all of which lasted until the early hours of the morning.Police report that the two groups have clashed before, beating each other with sticks and batons in another fight in August which required more than 100 police officers to bring the situation under control.The two factions claim their confrontation in August was about an argument over a parking lot but police believe the sides\u2019 enmity is part of a bigger dispute between the two clans.\u201cWe do not know the true background. It is certainly not a biker war. Rather, we believe that this is a dispute between two clans, with the connections the biker group has,\u201d\u00a0Mettmann District police spokesman Ulrich L\u00f6he said.The Cologne City Gazette notes that the confrontation would likely reignite the ongoing debate over the politically sensitive issue of no-go areas. Christian Democratic Union (CDU) interior expert Gregor Golland recently warned: \u201cIn North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) there are districts where clans have taken over the streets. After sunset, people and the authorities no longer dare leave the house.\u201dAsserting that areas of Germany are spiralling into lawlessness, Mr.\u00a0Golland said: \u201cWe must be careful that these districts not slip completely.\u201dThe Gazette reports that gangs and clans have taken control in neighbourhoods across the state\u2019s metropolises including Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Cologne, Dortmund, Aachen, and Bochum. Violence against the police has risen as much as 50 per cent in many of these areas.In the Duisberg district of Marxloh last summer, a female police officer was heavily beaten by a mob from a Lebanese clan while recording a traffic accident. Her colleague was only able to restrain the attackers by drawing his handgun.In December last year, the police chief of Gelsenkirchen met with leaders of the Lebanese clans after months of violence. The men made clear that they weren\u2019t wanting to negotiate peaceful coexistence with the force, telling him the police \u201cwill not win a war with the Lebanese, because we are too many.\u201dMembers of the \u201cFamily Union\u201d clan were unimpressed when the police chief announced the force planned to send more officers to \u201cproblem areas\u201d in the town.According to an internal police report, the men said: \u201cThe country has no money to be using so many policemen to seek confrontation with the Lebanese.\u201dGermany\u2019s Home Office completely denies the existence of no-go areas. Interior Minister Ralf J\u00e4ger said: \u201cIn North Rhine-Westphalia there are no lawless areas. The NRW police drive their police cars down every street in every district.\u201dInterior expert Golland said he considers the Interior Minister\u2019s statement \u201cwindow dressing\u201d. \u201cPeople that address the problems are denounced as traitors\u201d. Similarly, the Free Democratic Party\u2019s interior expert Marc L\u00fcrbke told the Gazette: \u201cCertain districts are now associated with significant risks for state officials.\u201dThe staffing situation of NRW\u2019s police force remains difficult. Responding to a question about how the number of cases of pickpocketing in Cologne is skyrocketing, the Interior Ministry\u2019s department head said policing would need to be \u201cthinned out\u201d in rural areas. The result, Wolfgang D\u00fcren admitted, is that police can now only afford to give \u201ca minimum level of protection for the population\u201d.The police union in the state (GdP) is viewing the situation in no-go zones with concern. GdP board member Volker Husz said: \u201cThe problem districts have significantly worsened in recent years.\u201cOfficials are insulted and threatened while they record traffic accidents, ambulance workers are attacked.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n sees the result, which saw 98 per cent of Hungarians vote to reject the European Union\u2019s mandatory resettlement of migrants, as a validation of his anti-mass migration policies.Though much of the reaction to the vote has been from Western leaders, now the Serbian government\u00a0has expressed fear that tougher border laws could mean they will be stuck with thousands of migrants who are no longer able to proceed north to Hungary,\u00a0reports Austrian paper Der Standard.Serbian paper\u00a0Vecernje novosti\u00a0wrote the headline \u201c7,000 Refugees Remain in Serbia\u201d on Sunday, the day of the Hungarian referendum. The Hungarian authorities have been tough on asylum seekers trying to cross the border from Serbia, which sits directly to the south, over the last few months \u2014 letting only around 30 in per day.While some have claimed that the Balkan route of migration has totally closed, for Serbians the picture is somewhat different as the country has received thousands of migrants this year. Most of the migrants have ended up in makeshift camps along the Serbian-Hungarian border in scenes similar to the Greek camp in Idomeni or the Calais Jungle camp.Serbian President\u00a0Tomislav Nikolic has called on the country to be proactive and\u00a0to tighten their own borders, to prevent the nation from filling up with migrants unable to proceed to Hungary.Reuters reports Nikolic said: \u201cIf Serbia becomes a funnel from which water cannot drain because others further along have shut their own borders, Serbia must shut down its own (borders) regardless of its convictions.\u201cIf Hungary did not anger the EU, Serbia will surely not\u201d.The official figures of how many migrants currently reside in Serbia is difficult to quantify, but the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) claims that there around 5,200 asylum seekers in various migrant camps in Serbia. The vast majority, some 60 per cent, are not Syrians, but are young Afghan men.Afghans have become the largest proportion of migrants in\u00a0European countries including Austria where they now make up the majority of residents in asylum homes. The asylum seekers all share common traits \u2013 they are all men and they are generally all young. Director of the Belgrade Asylum aid centre, Rados Durovic, puts the actual figure much higher saying that the real number is more likely from 7,000 to upwards of 10,000 asylum seekers in Serbia.Most of the\u00a0migrants in Serbia have little interest in staying in the country, preferring to be allowed to travel northwards to countries with more generous benefits like Germany or Sweden.Serbia also fears that a stronger policy from Hungary could lead to unrest among the growing migrant population on the border.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, hungary referendum, Serbia, serbian borderComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The province\u2019s largest party, the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party, supports Brexit.Lawyers for the politicians will argue that the British government is legally obliged to maintain the statutory recognition of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland, which contains references to the EU.The agreement ended three decades of tit-for-tat killings between Catholic Irish nationalists, who want the province to unite with Ireland, and Protestant unionists, who want to remain part of the United Kingdom. The conflict left 3,600 dead.They will also argue that the British government is legally obliged to safeguard EU laws incorporated into Northern Ireland law.In parallel, the court will hear a similar case being brought by Raymond McCord, the father of a man killed by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997, who says Brexit would undermine the Good Friday Agreement, the\u00a0peace process, and\u00a0human rights.\u00a0Breitbart London, BrexitComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In Paris, we celebrate high-end haute couture,\u201d said Jacob Abrian, the head of the Dubai-based Arab Fashion Council (AFC).In Dubai and the Arab world, \u201cwe want to be innovative\u201d, he said, with off-the-rack clothing that is tailored to haute couture standards and can be customised.For the first time in the region, the five-day show will also present a unisex collection signed by Rad Hourani, a Canadian-Jordanian designer known for his genderless creations.The fashion week opened with a \u201cready couture\u201d collection for women from Emirati designer Lamya Abedin in the first of more than 20 Spring/Summer 2017 collections from more than 10 countries.The collection drew applause from an audience of mostly women \u2014 some in mini-dresses and others covered from head to toe in the black traditional Abayas and even a niqab.The show ended with Abedin\u2019s young daughter taking to the catwalk with a model in a peach-coloured lace wedding dress.Now in its third edition, Arab Fashion Week aims to attract fashion conscious women from the Gulf, as well as luxury-orientated buyers from Russia and China.The event, founded in 2014 to represent the fashion industry in the 22 countries of the Arab League, introduced \u201cready couture\u201d after an in-depth study of the market, Abrian said.The form follows in the footsteps of limited ready-to-wear collections that can be customised, from famous fashion houses Roberto Cavalli and Dolce & Gabbana, he said.\u2013 \u2018Peace through fashion\u2019 \u2013AFC spokeswoman Daline Eluar said the group \u201caims to strengthen the role of the UAE, through Dubai, to become the fifth international fashion capital alongside New York, London, Paris and Milan\u201d.The fashion week seeks to show the world that the Arab region is not just \u201cwar and conflicts\u201d but also \u201ccreativity, art and beauty\u201d, she said.The Gulf city state is a growing tourist destination, a magnet for investors and home to one of the world\u2019s largest shopping malls.\u201cDubai has become a fashion capital after international capitals\u201d attracting tourists and designers alike, said Emirati haute couture designer Maryam al-Shaibani who spoke to AFP after the opening show.The cosmopolitan city state has been spared the wave of unrest that has rocked other Arab countries since 2011.Abrian said the AFC wanted to \u201ctailor peace through fashion\u201d by promoting Arab designers and attracting Western brands to manufacture in the region.During the week, the council will promote a Jordan-based initiative to set up the Arab world\u2019s first factory able to manufacture garments to international standards, he said.The initiative is part of a drive towards setting up a creative economy based on the region\u2019s art and culture within 10 years, he added.But much remains to be done, Abrian said, as customers still trust Western designers over their Arab peers.\u201cEverything that comes from Paris, from Milan is more appreciated,\u201d he said.\u2013 \u2018We have reached the world\u2019 \u2013The AFC hopes to counter this by promoting brands that are \u201cmade in Arabia\u201d.Shaibani however appeared more optimistic.\u201cInternational designers are starting to enter the world of Arab fashion designing\u201d by creating garments such as traditional Abayas worn by women in the Gulf region, she said. \u201cThis means that we have reached the world.\u201dEarly this year, Italy\u2019s Dolce & Gabbana launched their first line of hijabs and Abayas for Muslim customers in the Middle East.Islamic fashion will be on display throughout the event with brands from Malaysia and Indonesia, at a time of growing controversy in the West over Muslim women\u2019s clothing.\u201cWe believe that Islamic wear is very important and international brands are targeting\u201d it, said Abrian, adding that Muslim spending on fashion could reach $500 billion annually by 2019.Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, Weird News, Arab Fashion Council, Arab Fashion Week, Arab League, Dolce & Gabbana, Dubai, haute couture, uaeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The show follows an idealistic investigator for the Shin Bet (the Israeli equivalent of the FBI) as he deals with the ramifications of violent reactions on both sides of the escalating conflict.\u00a0A new command position thrusts him into a confrontation that undermines his faith and worldview, leading to a dramatic conflict between his values and the actions of those closest to him.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Keshet and this extremely talented and creative group led by Hagai Levi,\u201d said Casey Bloys, president of HBO Programming.Keshet was also behind \u201cHomeland,\u201d an adaptation of Israel\u2019s \u201cPrisoners of War.\u201dAmerican networks have made multiple attempts to film TV series in Israel but the conflict-ridden region has often made the task impossible.

Toner, Deputy Department Spokesperson, slammed the Jewish construction approval in a harshly worded statement that invoked Peres, a staunch supporter of the so-called two-state solution and the creation of a Palestinian state.The statement reads:\u201cWe strongly condemn the Israeli government\u2019s recent decision to advance a plan that would create a significant new settlement deep in the West Bank.\u201cProceeding with this new settlement, which could include up to 300 units, would further damage the prospects for a two state solution. The retroactive authorization of nearby illegal outposts, or redrawing of local settlement boundaries, does not change the fact that this approval contradicts previous public statements by the Government of Israel that it had no intention of creating new settlements. And this settlement\u2019s location deep in the West Bank, far closer to Jordan than Israel, would link a string of outposts that effectively divide the West Bank and make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote.\u201cIt is deeply troubling, in the wake of Israel and the U.S. concluding an unprecedented agreement on military assistance designed to further strengthen Israel\u2019s security, that Israel would take a decision so contrary to its long term security interest in a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the Palestinians. Furthermore, it is disheartening that while Israel and the world mourned the passing of President Shimon Peres, and leaders from the U.S. and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of peace, plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for the two state solution that he so passionately supported.\u201dHere, the State Department may be wrongly using Peres\u2019s name and legacy. Peres was an architect of the Oslo Accords, a land-for-peace process aimed at giving the Palestinians autonomy and eventually a state. But Peres did not argue for the complete dismantlement of the entire settlement enterprise or the evacuation of every Jewish community from the West Bank.\u00a0 Indeed, he was an early supporter of the settlement process.Peres\u2019s Oslo Accords called for a process to achieve a treaty based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, the only binding resolution pertaining to the West Bank. That document calls on Israel to withdraw\u00a0under a future final-status solution \u201cfrom territories occupied\u201d\u00a0as a result of\u00a0the 1967 Six Day War.\u00a0 The resolution does not call for a withdrawal from \u201call territories,\u201d\u00a0a designation deliberately left out to ensure\u00a0Israel\u2019s allowance\u00a0under a future deal\u00a0to retain some territory for security purposes.The Jewish Virtual Library explains:The Security Council did not say Israel must withdraw from \u201call the\u201d territories occupied after the Six-Day war. This was quite deliberate. The Soviet delegate wanted the inclusion of those words and said that their exclusion meant \u201cthat part of these territories can remain in Israeli hands.\u201d The Arab states pushed for the word \u201call\u201d to be included, but this was rejected. They nevertheless asserted that they would read the resolution as if it included the word \u201call.\u201d The British Ambassador who drafted the approved resolution, Lord Caradon, declared after the vote: \u201cIt is only the resolution that will bind us, and we regard its wording as clear.\u201dThe Palestinian Authority and much of the international community says Israel is occupying the so-called pre-1967 borders, meaning the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and eastern Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount. Israel refers to the pre-1967 territories as disputed.The Obama administration routinely complains about Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem but it has been silent on rampant illegal Palestinian construction on Jewish-owned property in eastern sections of Jerusalem. This includes the construction of dozens of apartment buildings on about 270 acres in the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Qalandiya and Kfar Akev and about 50 acres in a north Jerusalem suburb known as Shoafat. The land is undisputedly owned by a U.S.-based Jewish group.Shiloh, meanwhile, is the ancient Samarian city mentioned in the Torah as the resting place of the Tabernacle. The Book of Joshua also relates: \u201cThe whole congregation of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tent (or tabernacle) of the congregation there.\u201dAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

According to the official, a gag order has been imposed.A senior Abbas staffer confirmed to Breitbart Jerusalem that security measures have been stepped up \u201cin response to the growing incitement against him,\u201d but the president\u2019s agenda remains unchanged.\u201cThe president\u2019s participation in the funeral, alongside world leaders, chief among them President Obama, was crucial in countering the Israeli right\u2019s attempts to incite against the President and the Palestinians, which would have been successful had he chosen not to go,\u201d he said.The office of the President\u2019s spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, declined to comment.The simmering sentiments against Abbas culminated in a funeral procession of a resident of the Balata Refugee Camp, near Nablus, where participants called on him to resign following his participation in Peres\u2019 funeral.

Unfortunately, the whole world has seen over the last few years how American policy violated International Law and how it veered from every international convention. The Americans insist on the right they have wrongfully claimed to be above International Law. Moscow is well aware of this policy, following its special experience with America on the international level.\u201dBertrand Besancenot, the French Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, also told the paper that his country opposes the law \u201cbecause we are aware of the shockwaves it will send, namely undermining peace and security around the world.\u201dBesancenot added that he hoped Congress would take into account the problems the law would bring and reverse its decision.Jamal Shamykeh, Jordan\u2019s Ambassador, said that the law would infringe on the sovereignty of many countries, predominantly Arab.\u201cThe fact that President [Barack] Obama opposes it shows that it is a controversial law that was passed without sufficient debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on the same page with the Saudi government, because this law is a dangerous precedent that would encourage some countries to meddle in the internal affairs of others, especially America, because anybody could sue them.\u201dThe ambassadors of Egypt, Pakistan and Sudan were also quoted as opposing the law, with Egyptian Ambassador Nasser Hamdi warning the United States against \u201cthe adventure of gambling on its strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia,\u201d adding that the two countries pay the price of being at the forefront of the war on terror.Meanwhile, the Saudi news site SABQ quoted Alan Dibb, an American living in southern Saudi Arabia, near the Yemeni border. Dibb didn\u2019t refer to the faceoff between Washington and Riyadh directly, but praised Saudi Arabia and its people.\u201cAs someone who has spent the last four years training Saudi educators, I love the nature and the landscape in Saudi Arabia and admire its people, who are polite and always happy to help,\u201d he was quoted as saying .Dibb, who lives in the region of Jazan, said he felt much safer living next door to the fighting in Yemen than he did in Los Angeles. \u201cWhen the Saudi police ask me to leave, I do it. I\u2019m mainly concerned with the damage the war inflicts on ordinary people.\u201dHe added that there is good and bad, just like everywhere. \u201cI live and work with Muslims. We all follow the teachings of Abraham about hospitality, kindness and fairness to others, as well as praying and worshiping God.\u201dHe said he called on Americans and Saudis to treat each other with respect \u201ceven though we are often unable to understand each other. But God created all of us, that\u2019s why loving others is loving God and I\u2019m very happy to be an American living in Saudi Arabia.\u201dBig Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, 9/11 Reparations Law, 9/11 victims, Bertrand Besancenot, Saudi Arabia, Saudi government, Saudi media, US CongressComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In January, Israeli troops intercepted and rerouted the Gaza-bound boat Marianne, in a short operation without any casualties.The Swedish boat was carrying 20 activists, among them Israeli lawmaker Basel Ghattas (Joint Arab List) and former Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki.In 2010, Israeli naval commandos boarded the Turkish flotilla Mavi Marmara, which also attempted to break the blockade. The passengers on board attacked the troops using stun grenades and metal batons. In the violence, ten Turkish activists were killed and several IDF soldiers were wounded.The incident led to the severing of ties between Israel and Turkey for close to six years.

State television said insurgent shelling killed five people in government-held areas of the city on Tuesday.The army offensive is backed by an air campaign by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government and its allies that has hit hospitals, destroyed infrastructure and caused hundreds of civilian casualties.Another rebel commander from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group said the army opened several fronts simultaneously to stretch the rebel forces, and dropped leaflets from helicopters calling on them to surrender.After securing the strategic Handarat camp in the northern edge of the city last Thursday following what rebels described as carpet bombing, the army pressed on south of the camp.It took the ruins of the former Kindi hospital, from where soldiers could control the Jandoul traffic circle, a major road intersection. \u201cThey leveled the ground and our people had no choice but to retreat under the bombing of the Russians,\u201d the Zinki commander said.Rebels say Kurdish YPG militia controlling the strategic Sheikh Maqsoud district in north Aleppo city have also taken advantage of the army gains to move toward the Shuqayyif industrial area that lies between Handarat and their enclave.That would allow the army and its allied militias to move deeper into rebel-held northern districts of the city, although rebels expect the army thrust will slow in residential areas that offer them more cover from air raids.\u201cThe battles inside the city\u2019s districts as the regime applies more pressure will be difficult as these areas are better defended and will allow the rebels to hold out,\u201d said Halabi.In the heart of the city, war planes believed to be Russian and flying at high altitude hit Bustan al Qasr, Hay al Huluk and Fardous neighborhoods with reports of casualties, several rebel contacts said.In the Aleppo countryside, Russian and Syrian war planes dropped incendiary bombs on the towns of Darat Izza and al-Zirba.Separately, rebels fighting Islamic State militants said they killed at least 30 militants after a failed attempt to gain ground in Eastern Qalamoun area, north of Damascus, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Aleppo, Damascus, Kurdish YPG militia, President Bashar al-Assad, Russian warplanes, Sheikh Saed district, Syria civil warComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Citrons that pass muster for Sukkot sell for around 10 euros ($11) apiece, more than 10 times the rejects destined for processing into candied fruit, jams, soft drinks and anti-ageing cosmetics.The next \u201cetrog\u201d, as the fruit is called in Hebrew, does not make the grade.\u201cNo buono,\u201d says Mann, pointing to a handful of tiny black spots that indicate that this citron has been nibbled by an insect and is therefore deemed unclean.\u201cThe Bible tells us that the Sukkot fruit has to come from a beautiful tree,\u201d Mann explains.\u201cWe have learned that this means the citron and, for us, the best come from Calabria.\u201d\u2013 Expensive business \u2013The annual descent of dozens of rabbis, their trained assistants and other ultra-Orthodox Jews on this southern region has become a pilgrimage of sorts, one with roots in centuries of shared Italian and Jewish history.Notoriously hard to grow, the fragrant citron is one of four symbolic plants (along with palms, willow and myrtle) held while saying prayers during Sukkot, which begins this year at sundown on October 16.Translated into English as \u201cFeast of the Tabernacles\u201d, the week-long festival celebrates the unity of the Jewish people and the biblical account of their escape from slavery in ancient Egypt to the promised land via 40 years in the desert.Mann could pass for a diamond trader as he studies another newly-picked citron with a magnifying eyepiece.And like the gems business, there can be big money involved \u2014 with the best Calabrian etrogs changing hands for as much as $2,000-$3,000 in New York in the run-up to Sukkot.In London, a top price would be around \u00a3600 ($780/695 euros) but a shortage this year could push that higher, according to one dealer who was happy to share some tricks of the trade anonymously.\u201cI grade them 1-4,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the 3s and the 4s might not be a perfect shape or have some slight blemish. But it is a selling thing, you need them to sell the best ones.\u201cPeople want the best. It\u2019s God\u2019s fruit, if you buy his fruit, He will be good to your fruit (children).\u201d\u2013 Labour of love \u2013Samuel Ekstein, a member of the Satmar branch of Hassidic Judaism, sells cameras in Manhattan when he is not in Italy sourcing citrons.\u201cIt is a hard business,\u201d he says.\u201cSometimes you have a good year, good fruit and you can sell them all. Sometimes you have problems and you don\u2019t have good fruit. What happens is, you (will have) lost all your money. It all depends on God. If he wants you to make money, if not, you know\u2026 it\u2019s a risky thing.\u201dAccording to local expert Francesco Fazio, an ex-mayor of Santa Maria del Cedro, Calabria\u2019s production of citrons dates back to the arrival of the first Jews in Italy more than 2,000 years ago.A community has survived in Rome continuously since then but Jews were expelled from Calabria in the first half of the 16th Century as Spanish rule brought the anti-Semitism of the inquisition to southern Italy.\u201cThe community was destroyed but they left many markers, including the Eastern method of farming,\u201d Fazio said.Citron growing dwindled generally but survived along the Riviera dei Cedri thanks to the favourable coastal micro-climate.\u201cAn irreplaceable local culture has been passed down from father to son,\u201d said Fazio.\u201cThrough sacrifice and despite poverty, a piece of history has been preserved for humanity.\u201dLocal farmer Alessandro Farace says growing citrons is a sometimes painful labour of love.\u201cIt is not an easy fruit to grow. And the needles can really hurt you. It\u2019s very delicate and now with climate change, there seem to be more insects that attack it.\u201cYou have to have a passion for it. But it is our tradition and if we stopped doing it, where would they get their citrons from?\u201d\u2013 Not from Israel \u2013Calabria\u2019s citrons used to reach Jewish communities worldwide via wholesalers in Genoa \u2014 until some curious rabbis visited Calabria in the 1950s. To their horror, they discovered much of the fruit being produced from hybrid citron/bitter orange trees.\u201cThe Torah asks us to pray on a citron,\u201d says Shimon Lahiany a Jerusalem-based \u201cmashgiach\u201d \u2014 a rabbi or authorised supervisor of kosher food production.He has been coming to Calabria for 20 years now on behalf of his Chabad (Lubavitch) sect.\u201cA grafted citron can be better for the farm, but we are not allowed to bless it for the simple reason it is no longer a citron,\u201d he said.Grafted trees usually have a giveaway bulge on the trunk. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s under the ground \u2014 you need people who have had the rabbinical training to spot them.\u201dKosher citrons are also produced in large quantities in Israel and Morocco. But for some Hassidics, buying produce from Israel is not an option.\u201cWe believe the Jewish people are not allowed to (form) a nation before the Messiah comes,\u201d explains Ekstein.\u201cSo we don\u2019t take from Israel something we need for a holy (purpose).\u201dBreitbart Jerusalem, Faith, National Security, Hassidic Judaism, Italy, Jewish Diaspora, Jewish faith, Jewish traditions, Judaism, mashgiach, SukkotComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

A monitoring group said more than 400 civilians have been killed in and around Aleppo since the collapse of a US and Russian-brokered cease-fire two weeks ago, mainly in the rebel-held east.In central Syria, meanwhile, two suicide bombers struck the city of Hama close to an office of President Bashar Assad\u2019s Baath party, killing three people and wounding at least 11, state news agency SANA said. ISIS claimed responsibility in an online statement.SANA said a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-packed belt in Hama\u2019s al-Assi Square, and another suicide bomber struck 15 minutes later. One of SANA\u2019s photographers, Ibrahim Ajaj, was wounded as he was covering the explosions, the agency said, adding that he is in stable condition.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the two explosions killed three people and wounded 14.Suicide attacks in government-held areas are not uncommon, but blasts in the city of Hama, which is firmly under the control of Assad\u2019s forces, have been rare. The twin bombings came as various insurgent groups have been on the offensive north of the city.Another suicide bombing struck a Kurdish wedding outside the northeastern Syrian city of Hassakeh, killing at least 22 people, according to the Observatory, which said the toll was likely to rise. The Kurdish Hawar news agency confirmed the attack but did not provide a toll. The state new agency SANA said 20 were killed and 55 were wounded in the wedding. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.The death toll among the Syrian rebels near the Turkish border is the highest since Turkey sent troops and tanks into Syria in August to help rebels recapture ISIS strongholds in the area and curb the advance of a Syrian Kurdish militia, which Ankara views as an extension of Turkey\u2019s outlawed Kurdish separatists.Turkish military officials said 15 Syrian opposition fighters were killed and about 35 wounded in their offensive, which seeks to capture seven residential districts south of the town of al-Rai. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists across Syria, said 21 rebels were killed and more than two dozen wounded, adding that many of the casualties were due to land mines and booby-traps planted by the extremists.The Observatory said the Turkey-backed rebels are trying to reach the town of Dabiq, which occupies a central place in IS propaganda.The extremists, citing ancient prophecy, believe Dabiq will be the scene of an apocalyptic battle between Christianity and Islam. The group named its online magazine after the town, which it has occupied since August 2014.The Observatory said ISIS has been preparing for the battle in Dabiq for weeks, planting mines and explosives and sending some of its most experienced fighters to defend the town.The epicenter of the civil war remains in Aleppo, however, where Syrian and Russian warplanes have been pounding rebel-held areas since the breakdown of the cease-fire on Sept. 19.The Observatory said Russian and Syrian warplanes, and government artillery, have killed at least 387 civilians in rebel-held Aleppo and its rural surroundings, including 72 children and 24 women, since the truce broke down. In the rebel-held part of the city alone, 294 were killed. The group recorded 19 civilians killed in government-held Aleppo.In the offensive, which includes a limited ground operation, health facilities have repeatedly come under attack.On Monday, Adham Sahloul of the US-based Syrian American Medical Society, which supports various hospitals in rebel-held areas, said a bunker-busting bomb gouged out a 10-meter-deep crater where it landed near the entrance of one of the largest emergency hospitals in the rebel-held part of Aleppo. This is the third time the hospital has hit in a week, including once with several bombs. This time, the attack rendered it \u201cnot salvageable,\u201d said Sahloul.Sahloul said at least three maintenance staff were killed, including one found 100 meters (330 feet) away, apparently thrown by the impact of the explosion.The workers were carrying out repair work at the hospital following last week\u2019s attacks. Rescue workers are still searching for people under the rubble, and there were fears the building would collapse, Sahloul said. He added that since 2014 most of the hospital\u2019s facilities were set up underground to protect it.The Observatory confirmed the bombing, but put the death toll at six.In the central Hama province, a medical relief group and the Observatory said airstrikes have damaged and put one of Syria\u2019s most secure hospitals, which had been dug into a mountain, out of service.The International Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, or UOSSM, said the Dr. Hasan Al-Araj Hospital\u2014also known as \u201cCave Hospital\u201d\u2014was struck twice on Sunday.The Observatory said Russian warplanes carried out the attacks that hit the hospital, adding that it\u2019s one of the largest hospitals in rebel-held parts of the country. UOSSM said there were minor injuries from the attack.Dr. Abdallah Darwish, the hospital\u2019s director and health care chief in Hama province, was quoted in the UOSSM statement as saying that the hospital was likely struck by \u201cbunker-buster\u201d missiles as it was \u201cwell-fortified in a cave and impervious to previous attacks.\u201dThe bomb completely destroyed the hospital\u2019s emergency ward and caused major damage throughout the facility, he said.\u201cThese vicious and atrocious campaigns are literally choking the life out of civilians, they are deplorable and unacceptable,\u201d said Dr. Khaula Sawah, CEO of UOSSM USA.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Aleppo, baath party, Dabiq, Islamic State, Syria civil war, Syrian American Medical Society, Syrian Observatory for Human RightsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But both underscored deep mistrust and rising tensions between the former Cold War foes, who are increasingly at odds on a number of issues, particularly Syria and Ukraine. In the short term, the end of discussions on Syria deals a potential death blow to efforts to slow the civil war and begin negotiations on possible elections in the country that could mean the ouster of President Bashar Assad.Underscoring the deterioration between the US and Russia, Putin suspended a deal on plutonium disposal hours before the US announcement. The two powers will still continue discussions on the Iran nuclear deal, Ukraine and other non-Syria issues.The Russian Foreign Ministry said the US has \u201cdone all it could to destroy the atmosphere encouraging cooperation.\u201d It cited US sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine and NATO\u2019s deployment of forces near Russian borders.U.S. officials said that despite the suspension of talks with Russia, they would continue to work for a truce and aid deliveries to Syria in other gatherings, including the International Syria Support Group, a collection of nations, including Russia.The Obama administration said it decided to cut off discussions on Syria because Russia had not lived up to the terms of last month\u2019s agreement to restore a tattered cease-fire and ensure sustained deliveries of humanitarian aid to besieged cities, such as Aleppo, which has been under bombardment from Russian and Syrian forces.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that there is nothing more for the United States and Russia to talk about with regard to trying to reach an agreement that would reduce the violence inside of Syria and that\u2019s tragic.\u201d\u201cThis is not a decision that was taken lightly,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments \u2026 and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed.\u201dKirby\u2019s statement said that Russia and Syria are pursuing military action in violation of the cease-fire agreement, and pointed to their targeting of hospitals as well as the Sept. 19 airstrike on a United Nations humanitarian aid convoy. The US accused Russia of bombing that convoy, a charge both Russia and Syria have denied.Russia intervened on behalf of its close ally Syria on Sept. 30 last year, joining Assad\u2019s bombardment of both anti-Assad rebel groups and militant groups such as the Islamic State and Fatah al-Sham Front, an al-Qaida spinoff formerly known as the Nusra Front. Russia is interested in propping up Assad in part because Russia\u2019s only naval facility outside the former Soviet Union is on the Syrian coast.If it had been implemented, the cease-fire deal would have created a joint US-Russian center to coordinate military and intelligence operations. President Barack Obama had overruled Pentagon objections to such cooperation and Secretary of State John Kerry made the offer.According to a senior US official, the Pentagon has ordered troops who had been deployed to set up the joint implementation center \u2014 fewer than 20 \u2014 to return to their bases. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.The suspension will not affect communications between the two countries aimed at keeping their planes from bumping into each other over Syria.In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova voiced regret about the US move and blamed Washington for the failure to persuade the moderate Syrian rebels it backs to cut ties with extremist groups.\u201cAnd now, after failing to fulfill the agreements they worked out themselves, they are trying to shift the blame,\u201d she said.The US had agreed to separate the rebel groups but noted it was an extremely slow process. The US has relatively few personnel on the ground in Syria and even the moderate rebels have said they are frustrated with the pace of US help.Putin\u2019s decree on plutonium cited the \u201cemerging threat to strategic stability as a result of US unfriendly actions,\u201d as well as Washington\u2019s failure to meet its end of the cease-fire deal. It said, however, that Russia will keep the weapons-grade plutonium covered under the agreement away from weapons programs.Under the agreement, which was expanded in 2006 and 2010, Russia and the US each were to dispose of 34 metric tons of plutonium, enough material for about 17,000 nuclear warheads. When it was signed in 2000, the deal was touted as an example of successful cooperation between Washington and Moscow.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Islamic State, Middle East diplomacy, Moscow, President Vladimir Putin, Russian Foreign Ministry, Syria civil war, U.S.-Russia relations, WashingtonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Something that President Obama kind of help with the Iranian nuclear deal. But now you\u2019ve got Russia partnered with Iran using all sorts of Shiite proxies; meaning Hezbollah and of course also you\u2019ve got the Syrian military involved in all of this. So that is one side.And each side by the way has their own interests. Iran has its own power interests. Iran, with the Shiites, have their own religious fundamentalist beliefs about the Middle East and their own control. And then you\u2019ve got secular Russia, which has its own power structure that they are trying to impose not just in Syria but throughout the Middle East. And if Syria falls and if Syria becomes controlled in the future by the Iranian/Russian axis, we are going to have a certain kind of Middle East that would be very, very different from what it is today. Although today it is chaotic and a powder keg.\u201cSo you\u2019ve got that. In other words, bad news and trouble on one side. Iran and Russia. Partnered with the Syrian military and with Hezbollah on the ground.\u201cAnd what\u2019s amazing actually studying this is that the Iranians \u2013 the enemy of Western Civilization \u2013 partnered with the Russians, are actually fighting the other enemy of Western civilization. Which is the witches brew of jihadists that are being used, although I guess they don\u2019t know it, on the ground in Syria as a fighting army for the other side.\u201cAnd what is the other side? Well you\u2019ve got the Saudis. You\u2019ve got Qatar, Kuwait and in some ways Jordan. And Jordan here is playing with fire, by the way, by arming the Syrian rebels. Including the not-so-moderate Syrian rebels allied with al-Qaeda; allied with the Muslim Brotherhood; allied with Islamic State\u2026 So Jordan is playing with fire.\u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got the kingmakers of the Sunni empire, so to speak, if there ever will be one. Which is Turkey. Erdogan. Turkey, which has its own designs and its own religious belief system that they are trying to impose in Syria.\u201dKlein asserted that \u201cboth sides understand the significance of Aleppo.\u201dHe continued:\u201cUnderstand that this is the determining battle. What happens in Aleppo will determine the future of Syria. Will determine in part, by the way, the future of who (are) the powerbrokers in the Middle East. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got some desperate sides who understand that time is of the essence. Who understand there is no cease-fire. There are no negotiations. There is no dialogue.\u201cNegotiations? Ceasefires? The power all takes place not \u2026in the United Nations but on who has more control on the ground in Aleppo. In Syria. And then those actors \u2013 whether it is Turkey or whether it is it is the other side, AKA Russia and Iran \u2013 they are the ones who then would have significant power in diplomacy. So in other words what is playing out\u2026at the United Nations actually depends on what happens in these decisive battles in Aleppo.In the segment, Klein also explained the involvement of the U.S. and NATO, and he outlined the dangers mounting on Israel\u2019s northern border with Syria.\u00a0Breitbart Jerusalem, Muslim Brotherhood, National Security, Aaron Klein, Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, Aleppo, Iran, Iraq, ISIS, Islam, Islamic State, Israel, Jordan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Rebels, TurkeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It is unacceptable that it is led by someone who believes in collusion. Normalization continues to humiliate our brave people on a daily basis.\u201dFurther condemnation came from the Fatah student union at Bir Zeit University, the influential West Bank institution. Also opening with a quote from the Quran condemning collusion with the enemy, the union\u2019s statement said: \u201cThe humiliating and offensive participation [in the funeral] is a form of treason. Before the President went to the funeral of the criminal Peres, we appealed to all the government agencies hoping he would take back his humiliating decision.\u201dFollowing the announcement, Fatah stated it suspended the members behind the Abbas criticism. Some claimed that Abbas\u2019 critics were abused and threatened by the PA security forces.The Fatah rebels, meanwhile, celebrated Usama Mansur Abu Arab, a top official in the PA\u2019s Israel Coordination Directorate, who was suspended from his role for posting a Facebook post in which he called on Abbas to cancel his participation. Abu Arab was arrested over the weekend, which gave him even greater popular support.Abbas was criticized left, right and center on social media. Among the posts that went viral was a video of an 80-year-old Palestinian woman who insulted Abbas during an interview with her grandson. A cartoon showing Abbas as a kippa-clad Jewish soldier weeping at Peres\u2019 grave also went viral.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Bir Zeit University, Fatah, Islamism, jihad, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Shimon Peres funeral, Storm Forces of Fatah, Usama Mansur Abu ArabComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But if they could they would see what I saw behind closed doors all of those years ago. They\u2019d see a completely different human being from the one presented to the voters. Because in Hillary they\u2019d see a coarse, profane political operative. With no moral compass. And a complete willingness to manipulate the rule of law to her benefit. They would see a fearsome, paranoid individual with zero concern for the masses. She sees the voting block merely as a necessary evil to achieve her goals. She is a total impressive smoke and mirrors act.\u201dListen to Part Two of the Linda Tripp interview:Tripp revealed some of what she personally witnessed firsthand of Clinton\u2019s temperament and the way she says White House staff feared the First Lady to the point of \u201ccowering\u201d in her presence.\u201cIn the Clinton White House there was endless screaming,\u201d she recalled. \u201cConstant vulgar profanity on the part of both the President and the First Lady. And it\u2019s hard for me to refer to her as the First Lady, frankly.\u201cYou\u2019ve heard all about the hurling of hard objects. All of that was true. But what you haven\u2019t heard is the cowering of the White House staff in her presence. There was a contempt for the military. And this is a woman who believes she is entitled to be commander-in-chief. And that was very, very difficult for me. Having had a 20-year history with the military. And a deep, abiding respect for all the members of the Armed Services. She had a hatred of Republicans. And I have think we have seen that with her basket of deplorables (comments). Sometimes the truth just peaks out.\u201dAsked whether she actually saw Hillary throw hard objects at Bill Clinton, Tripp replied, \u201cNo, we just saw the result on the president\u2019s face. Literally.\u201dShe continued:\u201cI know that that sounds scandalous. And that sounds as though that couldn\u2019t possibly be true. But 99% of the scandals are completely unbelievable to those who didn\u2019t see behind the [Clinton] curtain. You know, it\u2019s almost a piling on kind of a thing. Because most people in their average everyday lives, they are going to work; they are driving the kids to soccer; there is homework; there are bills to pay. They don\u2019t pay as close attention as someone like myself might because they\u2019re just too darn busy. And it sounds like what the Clintons constantly say. That it\u2019s the partisan witch-hunt. That it\u2019s the vast right-wing conspiracy. Everyone conspires against the Clintons. They take no ownership or accountability for all of the scandals they themselves created.\u201cBut it\u2019s completely understandable to me why most people would think that this can\u2019t possibly be true. This is not the person we see debating. And she is a polished debater. You know this just can\u2019t be true and yet it is.\u201dListen to Part Three of the Linda Tripp interview:\u201cI just think that when you talk about temperament you have to at least consider how the past portends the future,\u201d Tripp added.The Clintons possessed no respect or honor for the office of the presidency, Tripp charged:\u201cI remember a senior adviser to President Bush. A nice guy. I am not going to name his name. But a very senior advisor who had said to a few of us one day that he pinched himself every single day that he entered the White House to go to work. And he said further if you don\u2019t feel that way you don\u2019t belong here. And it resonated because those of us who did feel that way thought, \u2018Ah, it\u2019s not just us. There is a reverence. There is an honor.\u2019 A feeling of history that we are so fortunate to be a part of. Of course, none of that pertains to the Clintons.\u201dHillary Clinton has in the past claimed numerous times that she was not yet decided on whether to run for president. One notorious example was Clinton\u2019s response to why she took six-figure speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and other big Wall Street banks. \u201cI wasn\u2019t committed to running. I didn\u2019t know whether I would or not,\u201d Clinton said in February.Tripp scoffed at the notion that Hillary was contemplating running for the presidency.\u201cWell, this is one of the funniest things because literally on my first day in the West Wing of the White House in January of 1993, right after the inauguration, there was a chant from various senior advisors to support staff of the president. And it was \u2018Eight years for Bill. Eight years for Hill.\u2019 In fact, some had started out with \u2018Four years for Bill. Four years for Hill.\u2019 And they were quickly corrected. But I didn\u2019t know at that time that this runaway train was actually going to happen. Or worse, what it means for all of us today.\u201cAnd you know she had a plan to punch her ticket. And so to punch the ticket to get to the presidency you need to have a resume. And so the whole Senate thing was part of the plan.\u201dTripp spoke generally of various ethical concerns during her time working in the West Wing:\u201cBoth the Clintons operate from a position of ethical bankruptcy. And in doing so they have been stacking the deck for many years. They have ensured they are above the law, as we saw this year. So whether it was obstructing justice or hiding documents. You know the abusing and besmirching of women. Their patented strategy of personal destruction of those who would speak out against them. And perjury.They have insulated themselves with total political power. And the accumulation of vast wealth. Those are hard things to go up against. So it\u2019s worked well for them\u2026And there was always the commingling and the pay-for-play. And I mean from the smallest way to the largest way. There was the wholesale selling of the Lincoln bedroom. And rides on Air Force One. And money all the time. It was just very difficult for someone who had seen another White House operate in a way that one would expect a White House to operate.\u201dListen to Part Four of the\u00a0Linda Tripp interview:Tripp is well-known for her role in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, documenting evidence of the young intern\u2019s relationship with Bill Clinton and submitting the documentation to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair.However, many people may be surprised to learn of Tripp\u2019s larger role in the West Wing, and her firsthand experiences behind the curtain of the Clinton scandal machine.Tripp was brought to the Clinton administration from the George H.W. Bush White House, where she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president, a role that enabled her to become familiar with the inner workings of the West Wing.During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton\u2019s Oval Office. After three months, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel\u2019s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals.Last week, Breitbart News reported on the first part of Clinton\u2019s interview on \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d in which she discussed some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Bill Clinton White House.Tripp possesses insider information on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster\u2019s office the morning after he was found dead in an apparent suicide. Foster was heavily involved in defending the Clintons in the Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater cases. Tripp was the last person known to have spoken to Foster before his death.During the first portion of our interview, Tripp reopened each of those scandals \u2013 Travelgate, Filegate, Whitewater and the issues surrounding Vince Foster\u2019s death \u2013 and she used her unique vantage point to explain how the notorious cases foreshadowed many of the current Clinton controversies, from the Clinton Foundation to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server troubles.Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Hospitals have been badly hit in the assault, medics say.While Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone to discuss normalization of the situation, Britain said the bombing of hospitals by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al Assad made it impossible talk about peace.\u201cIt is the continuing savagery of the Assad regime against the people of Aleppo and the complicity of the Russians in committing what are patently war crimes \u2013 bombing hospitals, when they know they are hospitals and nothing but hospitals \u2013 that is making it impossible for peace negotiations to resume,\u201d British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Syrian military said on Sunday that the army and its allies had advanced south from the Handarat refugee camp north of the city, taking the Kindi hospital and parts of the Shuqaif industrial area.Zakaria Malahifji, of the Aleppo-based rebel group Fastaqim, told Reuters there were clashes in this area on Sunday.The Observatory said air strikes and shelling continued on Sunday and there was fierce fighting all along the front line which cuts the city in two.The Syrian army said that rebel fighters should vacate east Aleppo in return for safe passage and aid supplies.\u201cThe army high command calls on all armed fighters in the eastern neighborhood of Aleppo to leave these neighborhoods and let civilian residents live their normal lives,\u201d a statement carried by state news agency SANA said.UNDER SIEGEEast Aleppo came under siege in early July after its main supply route, the Castello Road, fell under government control.International attempts to establish ceasefires to allow in United Nations humanitarian aid have failed, although other aid groups have brought in limited supplies.The relentless Russian and Syrian air campaign has badly damaged hospitals and water supplies.The U.N\u2019s Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Stephen O\u2019Brien, said he was \u201cdeeply alarmed by the ferocious pummeling of eastern Aleppo\u201d and reiterated U.N. calls for a pause in fighting, medical evacuations and access for aid.\u201cThe health system is on the verge of total collapse with patients being turned away and no medicines available to treat even the most common ailments.\u201d\u201cWith clean water and food in very short supply, the number of people requiring urgent medical evacuations is likely to rise dramatically in the coming days,\u201d he said.The European Union announced an initiative for Aleppo aimed at allowing humanitarian organizations to do their work and civilians to be rescued and protected.\u201cThe EU calls on all parties to urgently provide the necessary authoritizations for aid delivery and for medical evacuations to proceed,\u201d a statement said.On Saturday, the largest trauma and intensive care center in eastern Aleppo was badly damaged by air strikes and had to close.

Almost immediately, the suspect reportedly produced a pistol and \u201cshot Officer Snyder point blank,\u201d St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a reporter from KMOV CBS4.A second officer arrived on the scene as Snyder was shot. That officer returned fire, striking the suspect several times. The officer and the suspect were transported to area hospitals. Officer Snyder died from his single gunshot wound while the suspect remains in critical condition.\u201cFrom the time the suspect made it from the house to car, that\u2019s where Officer Snyder encountered him,\u201d Chief Belmar told reporters. \u201cOfficer Snyder, we believe at this point in the investigation, gave the suspect some commands because he couldn\u2019t see his hands. The suspect produced a pistol and he shot Officer Snyder point-blank. It was an immediately fatal wound.\u201dThe chief told reporters that paramedics worked diligently to save the officer. Doctors at St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital worked on the dying officer for more than an hour, but were unsuccessful in their efforts.Breitbart Texas reached out to the St. Louis County Police Department for more information about the alleged shooter. A response was not immediately available. The only description currently available is that the alleged shooter is an 18-year-old male, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Thursday morning. An update to that story indicates the 911 call came from the house of a girl who had a relationship with the reported suspect.St. Louis County Police Sergeant Shawn McGuire told the Post-Dispatch reporters that Snyder has been shot one time in the chin at \u201cvery close range.\u201d The incident occurred shortly after a 5 a.m. 911 call reported a man banging on the doors of a house trying to get in. Officer Snyder radioed minutes later that he had arrived at the scene.Chief Belmar told reporters in a press conference that the suspect was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a car when Officer Snyder arrived. The officer reportedly ordered the suspect to show his hands. Sgt. McGuire told the reporters the suspect then pulled a gun and fired one time, striking Snyder in the chin. Neither of the officers were wearing body cameras and the police cars are not equipped with dash cameras.McGuire said the suspect was the target of a drug investigation that Officer Snyder was involved in. He did not say if that played a role in the shooting. Responding to questions, Sgt. McGuire said the suspect was shot \u201ca lot.\u201d He is listed in critical but stable condition.The home is in a middle-class community. One neighbor, Mike Miller, told the Post-Dispatch reporters the home where the shooting occurred was one of the few trouble spots in the neighborhood. He told the reporters that a woman with a teenager and other children live there and the house is suspected of being a drug house. He said two youths were caught smoking marijuana in a car outside the home recently.Former Missouri State Representative Vicki Englund, who also currently serves on the local school board, also lives near the home where the shooting occurred. She was awakened to the sound of gunfire shortly after 5 a.m. Thursday. She heard the shots and then the voice of what she believed to be a police officer yelling orders at someone to get back in their home.\u201cI heard couple shots then a pause then I heard 10 or so in a row and someone yell \u2018Get back in the house\u2019 or \u2018Are you gonna get back in the house?\u2019 in a very strong, controlled voice,\u201d she told the local newspaper. \u201cAnd then a few more shots.\u201dA post on the county police department\u2019s Facebook page stated Officer Snyder was a four-year veteran. He leaves behind a grieving widow and a son. While a GoFundMe page has been established by a Facebook user, the department officially request that anyone wishing to make a donation do so through the local Backstoppers organization.Officer Snyder is the 97th law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. He is the 42nd to be killed by gunfire. He was the 10th St. Louis County police officer to be killed in the line of duty since the department\u2019s inception in 1955 \u2013 the first since the Halloween night shooting of Sergeant Richard Weinhold, 44, who was also responding to a disturbance call.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

In a statement, the Kerrville Fire Marshal said the juvenile, whose identity has not been released, is \u201cresponsible for causing the victim\u2019s severe burns,\u201d WOAI reported.More than 20 percent of 10-year-old Kayden Culp\u2019s body was seriously burned, from his ears to his belly button, said his mother Tristyn Hatchett. The incident happened on Sunday afternoon, October 2. Culp was rushed to University Hospital in San Antonio where doctors placed him in a drug induced coma and on a ventilator.Culp\u2019s family maintain\u00a0the attack was planned.\u201cThe other kids are saying that he was going to be riding his bike like he always is, my nephew Kayden is going to be riding his bike, and they said we\u2019re going to grab him and take him inside and burn him,\u201d said Culp\u2019s aunt Kelly Mack, to WOAI.

Smith reiterated they have not been able to produce any evidence to show there was any intent to commit bodily injury to any of the juveniles involved.Smith said\u00a0the Fire Marshal\u2019s office made the determination to charge the youth with first degree arson based on criteria including that the boy in question \u201ccommitted an offense by starting a fire or causes an explosion with the intent to destroy or damage any building, habitation, or vehicle.\u201d Smith cited the youngster\u2019s intentional \u201crecklessness\u201d in setting a fire, destroying property, and causes another person to suffer bodily injury or death. The\u00a0investigation remains ongoing. Because juveniles are involved, officers cannot share further information.Previously, it was reported Culp was a\u00a0special needs child.

The boy remained in a medically-induced coma and on life support.A YouCaring crowdfunding page was set up with a $10,000 goal to help the affected family with medical expenses. As of press time, the site raised nearly $105,000 and received 6,600 shares.Thursday morning, physicians said the boy\u2019s heart and blood pressure stabilized. Culp\u2019s mother posted an update on the fundraising site.She wrote:\u00a0Kayden is doing a little better today. They have taken him off the epinephrine. He was able to stabilize his heart rate and blood pressure on his own all night. Still on feeding and breathing machines. He is going in for his second dressing change soon. We will know more about the severity of his burns and lung damage afterwards. His swelling seems to be reducing now. The last dressing change caused him to plummet.

The charge rose from an incident where Matthews is alleged to have used a vehicle to attack two family members. He was also wanted on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and deadly conduct involving the discharge of a firearm, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).Shortly after being named to the top-10 list, law enforcement officers received a tip as to Matthews\u2019 whereabouts. Special agents from the Texas DPS Criminal Investigation Division closed in on the Aryan Brotherhood member and took him into custody without incident on the northwest side of Houston.Matthews is no stranger to the Texas prison system. Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas from Harris County District Clerk Chris Daniel\u2019s office revealed the gang member had an extensive criminal history. His record includes felony convictions of Burglary, Possession of a Controlled Substance, Evading Arrest, and Theft. He also has a record of misdemeanor charges of Assault on a Family Member, Trespass of a Building, Assault with Bodily Injury, and Theft.Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the criminal activities of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (ABT). In April 2013, an FBI document linking the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas with Mexican drug cartels was revealed. Despite the racist aspects of the gang\u2019s history, they tend to ignore race when engaging in their criminal activities.\u201cSeveral law enforcement\u00a0personnel\u00a0from the FBI and other agencies confirmed with Breitbart News that the Aryan Brotherhood\u2019s criminal activities are seldom driven by race; their focuses are drug and sex trafficking, as well as murder-for-hire,\u201d Breitbart reported at the time.Photographs showing neo-Nazi and gang tattoos hang in the gang unit office at the police station in Buena Park, Calif., Feb. 24, 2007. The white supremacist gang Public Enemy No. 1 began two decades ago as a group of teenage punk rock fans from upper-middle class bedroom communities in Orange County. Now, it\u2019s spreading to other Western states and gaining power as federal authorities weaken the Aryan Brotherhood and other established white supremacist gangs with racketeering charges and other crackdowns. (AP Photo/Ann Johansson)The FBI report clearly established links between the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican cartels.\u201cThe\u00a0publicly\u00a0available documents illustrate that the Aryan Brotherhood has\u00a0aggressively\u00a0pursued alliances with larger and more powerful crime organizations throughout its history,\u201d Breitbart Texas previously reported. \u201cThey have smuggled, trafficked, and killed on behalf of groups of all shapes, sizes, and\u00a0ethnicities in order to turn a profit. They are hired guns (or fists, or knives, or prison shanks, depending on the situation).\u201dEarlier that month, the Texas Governor Rick Perry appeared on Fox News and discussed the possible connection between Aryan Brotherhood members\u2019 possible involvement in the assassination of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife. He noted that the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican cartels have an established presence in the U.S. and that it would be foolish to dismiss the possibility of their involvement in the case.In January 2016, Breitbart Texas reported on the sentencing of the final two of 34 Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang members for their involvement in a methamphetamine distribution network. The article reported:The [Department of Justice] press release did not indicate specifically which cartel the ABT\u2019s meth supplier was affiliated with. Most of the major Mexican drug cartels are involved in meth production and distribution to different extents. However, Los Zetas and the Gulf cartel tend to have the broadest amount of influence in Texas. The ABT is a white supremacist gang which would normally never consider consorting with Latinos under any circumstances. When it comes to business\u2014and particularly drug trafficking\u2014the ABT and other race-based criminal groups will make interracial alliances if it means bigger profits.All 34 of the gang\u2019s leaders and members were convicted and sentenced to prison.Breitbart Texas reported in April 2015 about the connection between the Aryan Brotherhood and the Gulf Cartel:A series of federal court records that\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u00a0has researched\u00a0to point to a counter-intuitive but close working relation between the Aryan Brotherhood and the Gulf Cartel with the street gang profiting from drug distribution and carrying out contract muscle work for the cartel.Information about the tip leading to Matthew\u2019s arrest is being evaluated to determine if a Crime Stoppers reward will be paid, the DPS reported.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Sheriff David Clarke has called Clinton\u00a0 \u201ca straight up cop hater\u201d who is \u201call in with the criminal element.\u201d A leaked memo reveals that Soros is financing a movement towards federally-controlled police.\u201cThe number of police officers killed by gunfire on duty has doubled this year, even as President Barack Obama hinted racism on the part of state and local police officers may contribute to the deaths of African-American civilians during stressful confrontations,\u201d reported Breitbart News.Charley Wilkison, the executive director of\u00a0CLEAT\u00a0(Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas) was \u201cfact-checked\u201d by Politifact\u00a0on September 19 after he was quoted saying that \u201cTexas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America.\u201dWilkison told Politifact that his figures were from\u00a0the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). The names of officers lost in the line of duty, 1,955, is on the Texas Peace Officer Memorial in Austin. Eligibility is determined by the Commission on Law Enforcement under the TCOLE rules. While Wilkison\u2019s number was four higher than this total because of a local police department\u2019s paperwork tardiness, Politifact determined that Texas does in fact lead the nation in the number of officer deaths.Wilkison\u2019s interview with the\u00a0Texas Standard\u00a0occurred after the July ambush of Dallas police\u00a0officers at a Black Lives Matter protest. Wilkison was asked whether there was a \u201cheightened sense of fear since Dallas.\u201dBreitbart Texas provided coverage\u00a0of the tragic shootings and the aftermath when suspect Micah X. Johnson killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas. Johnson was killed after officers used a robot to set off a bomb near him. Johnson, a former New Black Panther Party member, said he \u201cwanted to kill white people especially white officers.\u201dThe Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) lists Texas as having 1,866 deaths caused by 27 categories of causes of death, 1096 of those were caused by gunfire, 59 were assaults, 75 were vehicular assaults, 48 were vehicular pursuits, and 170 were automobile accidents. The deaths include those dating back as far as 1837. California, New York, Illinois, and Florida had 1,569, 1,568, 1,070, and 757, respectively reported Politifact.On Tuesday at a Texas Senate Criminal Justice Committee hearing, a Democrat state representative who was allowed to sit in on the hearing responded to the number of downed Texas peace officers saying, \u201cTexas is only second to the state of California in officer killings.\u201d Texas State Representative Borris Miles (D-Houston) is the Democratic nominee for a state senate seat and is unopposed in the upcoming general election.Rep. Miles addressed the senators and the invited witnesses and others gathered there saying, \u201cMr. Wilkison, you stated that Texas has the largest killing of police officers. While I think it is only fair, respectful, that you tell the other side of that story. That Texas is only second to the state of California in officer killings. Only second to California.\u201d Miles then cited what he said were statistics from 2005 saying that there were 112 killings in the state of Texas by police officers that year. Miles said he has introduced three bills over the last eight years that have been opposed by peace officers. He said the bills involved subpoena powers, penalties against officers who use excessive force, and a bill dealing with the \u201cmental state\u201d of police officers. He said his bills were set for hearings but there was never any action on them.Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers Union (HPOU) was at the hearing along with other law enforcement leaders, including CLEAT executive director Charley Wilkison and Steve McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). When asked about the comments made by Rep. Miles, Hunt told Breitbart Texas on Wednesday, \u201cI think it is an outrage to compare someone armed and committing a crime, with a peace officer who is enforcing the law and someone is running at them with a gun.\u201dAs to the statement that officers have died in automobile accidents, the HPOU president said, \u201cIt is just ignorant to not know the difference between a Code 1 emergency, and the effect on the police department and their families.\u201dSenator Juan \u201cChuy\u201d Hinojosa (D-McAllen) seemed to try to make a distinction by speaking about the difference in the number of police vehicle wrecks versus gun violence committed against police officers. The CLEAT executive director told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe officers that died were not doing less, were not giving less, and their families have not lost less if they were changing a tire for someone and were killed when in service to the community.\u201d He added, \u201cThe whole process of denigrating the loss of lives of officers is not new, but it is more pronounced now.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice meet to hear invited and public testimony on several interim charges. Their\u00a0official tasks\u00a0as stated in the Senate Notice of Public Hearing was to: \u201creview law enforcement efforts to engage community leaders and increase their involvement in communities. Assess dangers to law enforcement officers and the collection and distribution of threat assessment data. Make recommendations to reduce the number of injuries and deaths to or by law enforcement officers.\u201dBreitbart Texas was at the Waller County, Texas, jail in August 2015 for a\u00a0Sandra Bland protest when a\u00a0group of armed members of the New Black Panther Party marched chanting \u201cThe revolution is on\u2026 Off the pigs,\u201d and\u00a0\u201cOink Oink\u2026 Bang Bang!\u201dLess than two weeks later, 30 miles down the road,\u00a0Deputy Darren Goforth was murdered in cold blood at a gas station. Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0the deputy\u00a0was approached from behind as he walked out of the convenience store in northwest Harris County. He was in uniform at the time of the attack. The deputy was shot 15 times from behind. Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman, and the indictment against the black defendant who is suspected of killing him, stated that Deputy Goforth was executed just because he was a cop.Although law enforcement officers have been criticized for police shootings, Breitbart News reported\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s a huge and growing body of statistical and witness evidence\u00a0that police forces are\u00a0less likely to shoot blacks than whites when enforcing the law amid disproportionate\u00a0and growing criminal violence in African-American communities.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

He was booked into\u00a0Lew Sterrett Jail. Although Ruiz\u00a0had no prior criminal record, his bail was set at a total of $200,000 for both charges.Smith said a former student called a DPD detective on October 3. She claimed Ruiz sexually assaulted her eight years ago when she was seven years old and a first grade student in his class.WFAA reported\u00a0that the\u00a0purported victim, now age 16, told the detective\u00a0she was in class when Ruiz called her over one day while other students were outside at recess.\u201cMr. Ruiz had called her over and told her to reach inside his pocket because there was a bunny in there,\u201d read\u00a0the arrest warrant. She said there was a hole in Ruiz\u2019s pocket. When she reached in, she felt his genitals. Two years later, she realized what had happened. The girl told police, she did not tell her mother what happened previously because she was afraid but eventually overcame her fears, the court documents stated. Authorities charged\u00a0Ruiz with continuous sexual abuse of a young child.Assistant Police Chief Smith said,\u00a0through additional investigation, a second victim came forward with similar accusations about Ruiz. He\u00a0was charged with indecency with a child by contact.\u201cCurrently, there are possible additional victims that have come forward who have been scheduled for interviews,\u201d said Smith on Wednesday.\u00a0She encouraged parents to discuss \u201cthese situations with their kids, listen to their children because children will give them information, and if they have anything that is concerning to them, please contact the police department.\u201dKramer Elementary parents were shocked to learn about Ruiz at afternoon pickup. Pete Peabody, whose first and second grade children attend Kramer, told WFAA: \u201cA lot of these parents chose to send their kids here because of the quality of the environment.\u201d Another father, Bruce Kaye, met Ruiz when his students attended Kramer. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a criminal defense attorney and I didn\u2019t get any type of \u2018creepy meter\u2019 vibe or anything like that. (Ruiz) has been here a long time and, at the same time, you have to take everything this child has said very seriously because these are very, very serious allegations.\u201dDallas ISD spokeswoman Robyn Harris described the matter as \u201cvery serious.\u201d She said in a statement:\u00a0\u201cWhile we are unable to comment on this personnel issue involving a teacher, we can share that the individual has been placed on administrative leave. We will continue to cooperate with authorities, and remain committed to providing a safe instructional environment for our students each day.\u201dThis situation\u00a0comes as the state\u00a0grapples with a record 222 cases of improper relationships between teachers and students opened in the 2015-16 school year. Last year marked the eighth consecutive year these cases\u00a0increased, an 80 percent jump\u00a0in reported incidences compared to the 2008-09 school year. Then, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) opened 123. In their 2018-19 budget, the agency asked\u00a0state lawmakers for nearly\u00a0$400,000 to cover three investigative unit new hires to better combat the problem.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Assistant Chief Christina Smith, Dallas Independent School District, Dallas Police Department, Educator, Inappropriate Educator Relationships, Jorge Ruiz, Kramer Elementary School, Teacher-Student Sexual MisconductComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Reynosa government revealed that the three former city employees had binders and file cabinets that they were loading into an SUV. The files included information about city checking accounts and other documents from the former government auditor\u2019s office.Law enforcement sources in Tamaulipas consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that the theft appears to be an effort to hide the embezzling of funds by former city officials.The theft of files and accounting documents comes just days after the swearing in of Maki Ortiz Dominguez from the Partido Accion Nacional party (PAN) who replaced Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Elias from the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI).\u00a0 In response to the theft, Ortiz Dominguez has ordered an extensive investigation to track down any missing documents from the previous administration. During Elias\u2019 term, the Gulf Cartel was able to operate with almost complete impunity in Reynosa. Breitbart Texas has reported on the various gun battles, kidnappings, and other crimes that spread terror throughout the city. The former mayor\u2019s office was also accused by local residents of downplaying or ignoring the out-of-control violence that plagued the city. Ortiz Dominguez won her bid for mayor this summer when candidates from the PAN saw a landslide victory against many of the PRI. As Breitbart Texas has previously reported, the PRI has a long history of corruption and ties to Mexican drug cartels including the Gulf, Los Zetas, Beltran Leyva and the Juarez Cartels. Two former governors of Tamaulipas, Eugenio Hernandez and Tomas Yarrington, are currently considered fugitives by the U.S. Department of Justice. In a similar fashion, Breitbart Texas has also reported how a former mayor of the border city of Matamoros, Erick Silva from the PRI, is also considered a fugitive by the DOJ on money laundering charges. Silva has denied the fact that he has a criminal case against him in the U.S. and has called it a political maneuver.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The letter, which the TEA received October 3, was in response to a recent Houston Chronicle\u00a0investigation\u00a0that\u00a0alleged school districts which provide specialized education services to more than 8.5 percent of students get penalized.Breitbart Texas obtained a copy of the letter written by Sue Swenson, Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Education Department Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSER), to Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath. She stated: \u201cIt appears that the State\u2019s approach to monitoring local educational agency compliance under the PBMAS Indicator 10 may be resulting in districts\u2019 failure to identify and evaluate all students suspected of having a disability and who need special education.\u201d\u201cBased\u00a0on TEA\u2019s response,\u201d Swenson wrote, these federal agencies \u201cwill determine whether additional monitoring activities or other administrative enforcement or corrective actions are necessary.\u201dThe letter cited the Houston newspaper findings that,\u00a0in 2004, nearly 12 percent of Texas students received some form of special education services including tutoring, therapy, and counseling but this figure was down to 8.5 percent by 2015. The publication\u00a0stated the national average hovers around 13 percent and that Texas is the only state to set a target for special education enrollment.According to the Houston Chronicle, the\u00a0TEA quietly implemented an \u201carbitrary\u201d 8.5 percent target\u00a0without consulting the Texas Legislature, State Board of Education, federal government, or any\u00a0research. The report asserted the\u00a0TEA required some school districts that served more than this percentage of students to create \u201cCorrective Action Plans\u201d and schools responded by making special education much harder to access.Also, the publication\u00a0reported the TEA\u00a0denied they prevented disabled students from receiving services and said the 8.5 percent enrollment guideline was not a cap or a target but an \u201cindicator\u201d of performance by school districts.In the letter, Swenson referenced a 2014 conversation between Gene Lenz, Director of TEA\u2019s Division of Federal and State Education Policy, regarding the use of the 8.5 percent \u201cmonitoring standard\u201d in PBMAS Indicator 10.Swenson wrote:\u201cMr. Lenz explained that this indicator was established to address the State\u2019s concern that some districts were inappropriately over identifying students as students with disabilities. He further explained that an elevated PL [Performance Level] was not necessarily indicative of a district noncompliance, but that if a district exceeded the 8.5 percent monitoring standard, the State examined the district\u2019s policies, procedures, and practices more closely to ensure that students were not being inappropriately identified as students with disabilities. If noncompliance was identified through this monitoring process, the district was required to correct the non-compliance.\u201dSwenson commented that Lenz assured OSER staffers that Texas monitors to ensure districts carry out their \u201cChild Find\u201d responsibilities to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities who are in need of special education and related services statewide.Child Find is\u00a0a federal mandate under the\u00a0Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u00a0(IDEA). It requires all school districts to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, regardless of the severity of a disability. The mandate applies to all children from birth through age 21 and includes youngsters\u00a0who attend public and private schools, as well as those\u00a0considered highly mobile, illegal immigrants, and who are wards of the state, according to Wrights Law.The letter gives the TEA 30 days to respond to \u201callegations\u201d raised by the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u2019\u00a0regarding the agency\u2019s special education practices. In response to receiving this correspondence from U.S. Education Department officials, the TEA issued a statement:\u201cTexas school districts are obligated by law and agency policy to identify and provide services to all students with disabilities who require special education services.\u00a0All Texas students who are entitled to special education services at school should have access to the services they need.\u00a0The Texas Education Agency welcomes the opportunity to discuss specific components of the\u00a0Performance-Based Monitoring Analysis System (PBMAS). In addition to our discussions with federal officials, TEA will continue its own internal review, working with\u00a0special education advisory groups for feedback and guidance on all aspects of special education policy.\u201dFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.10.03.16 US Education Department Letter to TEA\u00a0by BreitbartTexas on ScribdBreitbart Texas, Education, Child Find, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, PBMAS, special education, Texas Education, Texas Education Agency, U.S. Department of EducationComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Thousands of children were left vulnerable during those decisive hours. Over 14,000 children were left unchecked in those critical hours after a report of neglect or abuse in mid-September, reported the\u00a0Austin American Statesman.\u00a0It was reported that almost 2,000 of these cases were urgent or emergency situations.The\u00a0Texas Tribune\u00a0reported that for each day in the last six months, almost a 1,000 \u201chighest priority\u201d children were not checked. Children have been placed in this category by the agency because of the immediate risk of physical and sexual abuse.\u201cGovernor Abbott and Commissioner Whitman have both clearly stated that the protection of children from abuse is a top priority. The data indicates CPS is falling short of that goal and we absolutely have to get better. These kids have to be seen,\u201d said Patrick Crimmins, media relations manager for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS).In April of this year,\u00a0Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed a former chief of the Texas Rangers as new Commissioner of the embattled agency. TDFPS (also referred to as \u201cCPS\u201d) is the agency responsible for protecting abused and neglected children in the state, among other responsibilities.Breitbart Texas has reported about the abuses, problems, and overreach in the agency, particularly among CPS caseworkers. There have been horrific abuses of children who are in the state\u2019s foster care system.The Texas Governor said at that time of the new appointment, \u201cThe status quo at CPS is unacceptable. Our children are too important to suffer through the challenges they\u2019ve faced. I\u2019ve insisted on overhauling a broken system.\u201d\u00a0Abbott added, \u201cI applaud the leadership changes that will provide a new direction and focus that puts protecting children first.\u201d\u00a0The Governor appointed Henry \u201cHank\u201d Whitman as the DFPS commissioner.In April 2014, the advisory council at the department\u00a0approved new agency rules\u00a0after children died while in CPS foster care, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Two-year-old Alexandria Hill and 11-month-old Orien Hamilton both died of blunt-force head injuries sustained by the hands of foster and kinship caregivers approved by CPS. Children are placed in homes that have been approved by child-placing agencies (CPAs) licensed by the CPS. The department licenses the foster child-placing agencies that recruit, investigate, and train potential foster and kinship parents. They also monitor the placements once these individuals become caregivers.\u00a0The new rules which took effect in September of 2014 only applied to new foster homes.Alex Hill died in July 2013 while in a Milam County foster home run by the Department\u2019s #3 foster care contractor, Texas Mentor. Her foster caregiver, Sherill Small, was charged with capital murder after she\u00a0showed law enforcement officers how she smashed Alex\u2019s head against the floor. Rockdale Police Chief Thomas Harris stated that Small became frustrated after Alex got into food and water before the Smalls woke-up one morning. Small \u201cpunished\u201d Alex by making her stand in a dark room for four hours. The Arlington office of Texas Mentor was placed on probation after 114 infractions were found at 56 foster homes during the two years prior to Alex\u2019s death.Orien Hamilton died in October 2013 when she was in an Austin foster home that had been approved by Lutheran Services of the South, the Department\u2019s top CPA.\u00a0The foster mother\u2019s ex-husband, Jacob Salas, pinned Orien\u2019s head to the floor with his knee. Orien already had broken ribs which had partially healed. Orien had a fractured skull, bleeding of the brain and detached retinas. Salas was\u00a0a prison guard who had a history of violence and abuse.\u00a0The foster mother had been licensed in October and the child died less than two weeks later. Orien\u2019s biological father claimed that he had warned Texas officials that Orien was in danger, as reported by\u00a0the Dallas Morning News.According to CPS statistics, there was an alarming increase in the number of deaths of foster children in the agency\u2019s 2013 fiscal year. Eight foster children died in fiscal year 2013; two children died in foster care during fiscal year 2012. Another child died in foster care after the Department\u2019s fiscal year 2014 began in September 2013.In December 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against CPS. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the lawsuit was filed by a New York advocacy group called Children\u2019s Rights. About 12,000 children who were in long-term care in Texas were included in the class action suit. The advocacy group successfully sought and received a scathing order from a federal district judge.Judge Janis Graham Jack ordered the State of Texas to enact reforms. In so doing, the judge wrote an opinion that said that the long-term foster care system was\u00a0improperly run. She also called it a place \u201cwhere rape, abuse, psychotropic medication and instability are the norm,\u201d as reported by the Dallas Morning News in December 2015. The judge noted that the DFPS and Judge Specia had \u201cthe best intentions\u201d but the system is underfunded. She called the long-term foster care system in the state \u201cbroken.\u201dIn March 2015, Breitbart Texas reported that Texas Governor Greg Abbott directed the DFPS to implement comprehensive reforms. The reforms were aimed at protecting children in the agency\u2019s care. Nine children died under DFPS\u2019 watch during 2014.TDFPS spokesman, Patrick Crimmins told Breitbart Texas on Wednesday, \u201cSpecific to the problem of not seeing children when abuse reports are made, the key to seeing more kids is to get more workers in the field asap. To do that, we have asked for 510 more investigative caseworkers and more CPS Special Investigators.\u201dThe Department\u2019s\u00a0Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR) for fiscal years 2018-2019 includes the following \u201cEXCEPTIONAL ITEM REQUESTS.\u201d As can be seen by the Administrator\u2019s Statement in this LAR, the Department is requesting funding \u201cabove the FY 2018-19 baseline request for six exceptional items totaling $498.1 million general revenue ($534.0 million All Funds).\u201dThe LAR Administrator Statement provides, \u201cNew staffing requests total 1,823.4 FTEs in FY 2018 and 1,943.0 FTEs in FY 2019. This request builds on recent improvements and aligns with the ambitious goals in my 10-point plan. To be successful, this agency must have the resources to fortify and improve the child welfare system and provide young parents with resources to build safe and healthy homes.\u201dThe exceptional items are grouped within eight goals:On September 14, Breitbart Texas reported that CPS announced a new strategic plan to \u201craise the bar\u201d in preventing child abuse in the Lone Star State. The goal is to move from a plan based primarily on investigation-based efforts to an overall effort to strengthen families.\u00a0Officials stated the goal of the plan is to reduce the numbers of incidents of child abuse and neglect. More specifically, the goal is to reduce the numbers of serious injuries and fatalities, according to a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas from CPS officials.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

U.S. Border Patrol Supervisory Agent Marlene Castro described the operation as \u201cdeplorable\u201d in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.\u201cDeplorable\u201d stash house discovered in Hidalgo County, Texas. (Photo: U.S. Border Patrol)The agents worked with state and local law enforcement officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Hidalgo County Sheriff\u2019s Office to obtain a search warrant and carry out the raid on the human smuggling warehouse. When the task force arrived at the apartment complex to carry out the raid, they discovered a total of 56 people inside the two small apartments. All admitted to being inside the United States illegally.Five of the people who were discovered inside the apartments, two men and three women, were engaged in the smuggling operation acting as \u201ccaretakers\u201d for those confined in the stash house, Castro wrote in the statement. They were arrested and turned over to authorities for possible prosecution.The 51 illegal immigrants, who were treated as cargo by the human smugglers and crammed into the small apartments, were taken by CBP officials for processing as illegal immigrants. No information was provided as to the gender of those being smuggled or if any minors were involved. The illegal immigrants were reported to be from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the inhuman treatment of these illegal immigrants by their Mexican cartel connected human smugglers. Two weeks ago, the raid of a stash house in Houston yielded 12 illegal immigrants on the city\u2019s north side.Just two weeks prior, 52 foreign nationals were found in another Hidalgo County stash house. Two if the individuals were part of the smuggling operation according to officials, while 50 were illegal immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. The 50 were being held in a house designed for a small family.In April, Breitbart Texas reported on the fate of these human smuggling \u201cpassengers\u201d who often have no idea of what is in store for them as they leave the stash houses in the Texas border region. Brooks County, located about 80 miles north of the Texas/Mexico border is a prime example of the dangers faced by those who turn their lives over to the cartel connected smugglers. Women are frequently raped, men are beaten, people are held hostage for more \u201ctransportation fees,\u201d and immigrants are left to die in the ranch fields surrounding the Falfurrias Border Patrol checkpoint located in the middle of the county.These abuses clearly illustrate the inhumanity faced as a consequence of our nation\u2019s unsecured border.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Sanchez was indicted earlier this year with 60 other MS-13 gang members. The 33-page indictment is attached below. Five other co-conspirators have already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from this indictment.The deal follows a three-year investigation that led to the indictment of the criminal activities of alleged leaders, members and associates of the MS-13 gang in the commonwealth. Sanchez was identified as a member of the MS-13 Eastside Loco Salvatrucha (ESLS) clique. His role was to \u201cjump in\u201d new members of the gang. He paid street dues to fund the MS-13 activities both in Massachusetts and El Salvador. Under the plea bargain, Sanchez admitted that he and other members of the gang were involved in stabbing a member of a rival gang. The victim of that crime was reported to be a member of the rival 18th Street gang. The incident occurred near Bellingham Square in Chelsea in December 2015, officials stated.In the original indictment, Sanchez was also charged for immigration violations for fraudulent documents. No information as to Sanchez\u2019 nationality or immigration status have been provided by the DOJ at this time. Sanchez pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Dennis Saylor IV. The judge scheduled a sentencing hearing for December 22 where Sanchez could face up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.The MS-13 gang originated out of El Salvador but has engaged in criminal activity across the United States. In September, Breitbart Texas reported on another MS-13 gang member who was charged in a Maryland homicide. In that case, Oscar Delgado-Perez, 28, is accused of brutally stabbing 18-year-old Christian Villagran-Morales to death in what appears to be a gang\u2019s bragging rights.Border Patrol agents in south Texas recently captured three MS-13 members from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador as they re-entered the United States from Mexico. A few days earlier, another MS-13 gang member from Honduras was captured by Border Patrol agents in southern California.Breitbart Texas has been covering this violent transnational gang for several years. In July 2013, four MS-13 gang members were convicted on counts of murder, armed robberies, and firearms offenses. That trial lasted for four weeks. At that time, FBI officials indicated members of the MS-13 gang were active in at least 42 states and had between 6,000 and 10,000 members.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The couple was identified at the time as 28-year-old Valentin Guerrero and 24-year-old Montserrat Reyes Galaviz.As a result of various probes into the case, officers with Coahuila\u2019s Investigative Police identified Luis Leonel Morales Salas as one of the likely gunmen in the case. Information provided to Breitbart Texas by law enforcement sources revealed that the officers tried to arrest Morales Salas during a traffic stop in the city\u2019s south side. Rather than stop, the suspect sped off and began shooting back at law enforcement while the state police officers returned fire. The fleeing gunman ran a local taxi driver off the road, causing him to crash. Authorities were able to catch up with Morales Salas shortly thereafter.During questioning, Morales Salas confessed to his role in the murder in what authorities are calling an \u201cajuste de cuentas\u201d or cartel reckoning. The man is currently facing aggravated kidnapping and murder charges. Breitbart Texas consulted with law enforcement officials who revealed that the two murder victims had ties to organized crime.

The man is currently wanted on an active warrant for \u201cpossession of child pornography\u201d from the State of Texas, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

As agents moved in, the two men split up and fled. Agents captured one of the men following a brief foot chase, officials stated. The man was reported to be carrying a backpack loaded down with marijuana.The second suspect managed to elude the agents and a search continued to locate the illegal immigrant. The agents were able to locate the backpacks being carried by the two men. They contained nearly 100 pounds of marijuana, estimated to be worth $76,960. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency were contacted to take custody of the 21-year-old Mexican national, Sergio Frias Ladarda, and the drugs. The man will face the possibility of prosecution for drug smuggling.On October 2, Las Cruces agents assigned to the I-10 Border Patrol checkpoint observed a Toyota pick-up truck approaching their position. Agents observed the nervous behavior of\u00a0the driver. A records check on the truck revealed the vehicle was stolen. Agents asked the man to pull forward to a secondary inspection station. The driver decided to ignore the order and fled the checkpoint leading agents on a high-speed chase.Agents contacted the New Mexico State Police who dispatched highway patrol officers to assist the Border Patrol agents in stopping the pursuit. Police successfully deployed tire-deflation devices which brought the Toyota truck to a stop.

Moss\u2019 criminal history revealed convictions for burglary, terroristic threats, and manufacturing/possession of methamphetamine, according to CBP officials.

All had prescription pain-killer rates higher than the number of residents living in the state.Medical Director Dr. David Holcombe of the Office of Public Health Region VI in Central Louisiana told WWL-TV New Orleans that the issue was a rapidly-growing problem where big pharmaceutical companies push for more and more prescription pills.\u201cThis has been a disaster almost created and then perpetrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by pharmaceutical greed, physicians prescribing and patient demand.\u201dHolcombe said that the \u201cepidemic\u201d of prescription pain-killers in these states is not exactly an accident, but rather an orchestrated plan.\u201cWe have been building to this,\u201d Holcombe told WWL.Big pharmaceutical companies not only have great influence over the fast-track pace of prescribing pain-killers, but the industry also has a favorite candidate in the 2016 presidential election.As far back as March, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had already been the biggest benefactor of big pharmaceutical companies, with donations for her candidacy surpassing $500,000 from the industry, according to CNBC.Louisiana specifically, though, has not been a stranger to vast opioid use.In the city of New Orleans, heroin laced with a dangerous opioid drug called fentanyl has become the biggest threat with respect to drugs and addiction, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).The DEA said fentanyl is 50 to 100 times stronger and more dangerous than morphine, along with being cheaper than heroin.Over 65 deaths in New Orleans this year have been tied to opioid abuse, according to previous statements by the city\u2019s coroner who said the rise of the drug has been prevalent since 2014.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Two adults were in the truck with the children and a two-year-old child was sitting on the lap of an adult passenger in the front seat.According to the report by CBS5 in Phoenix, six-year-old Tyrik Jenkins was killed when a Dodge pickup truck driven by 19-year-old German Valdemar Godinez-Godinez hit a Ford Ranger that was making a left turn. The boy was ejected from the bed of the truck and was taken to an area hospital where he later died.The CBS affiliate reported that he is a citizen of Guatemala and considered a flight risk because he has family there. He was reported to have run a red light and allegedly told authorities that he did not see the red traffic light because the visor in his truck was down.Godinez-Godinez was booked for driving under the influence (DUI) and faces one count of manslaughter and five counts of endangerment, according to the report. The judge set a $250,000 cash bond.Officials with the Maricopa County Jail confirmed to Breitbart Texas that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has placed an immigration detainer on the suspect.A court date has been set for the Guatemalan for October 15.Breitbart Texas continues to report about the crimes committed in Texas and other areas by those who are not citizens, are illegal aliens, or illegal aliens that have committed other crimes.In mid-May, Breitbart Texas reported that a previously deported illegal alien killed a teenage girl and critically injured her prom date. Edin Palacios blamed police from who he was fleeing at the time. Palacios, a Guatemalan,\u00a0was observed driving drunk in the early morning hours of May 14th. When officers attempted to stop the pickup truck after it ran over a curb while making a U-turn, the driver pulled over and took off after the police officer got out of his car, Breitbart Texas reported.In April, a Nebraska judge set a $2 million bond for a fugitive illegal alien charged in a hit-and-run DUI homicide case. The DUI is allegedly the fourth for the illegal alien ordered deported in 2012.\u00a0Orline Carrasco-Zelaya (a.k.a Edwin Elvir-Palma), was charged with felony counts of vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a personal injury accident resulting in a death, and an aggravated DUI for his third offense.

Breitbart News reported that she faced\u00a0felony charges of gross vehicular manslaughter, driving under the influence, hit and run, and a misdemeanor count of driving without a license. The man was hit at 6 a.m. when he was walking on the sidewalk. Esteysi Sanchez Izazaga drove about a mile with the man still in her window. He was hit so hard his leg \u201cdetached from his body and flew through the back window, landing on the truck of the car.\u201d She said she fell asleep and woke-up when shattered glass from her windshield hit her in the face.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Last year, the TEA investigated a\u00a0record-breaking 222 cases. This reflected an 80 percent increase in cases\u00a0compared to the 2008-09 school year when the agency opened 123. In\u00a02009-10, they reported 141 cases; in 2010-11, 152 cases; 2011-12, 156 cases; 2012-13, 163; 2013-14, 179; and 2014-15, 188.The 2014-15 spike was\u00a0so troubling that Lt. Governor Dan Patrick\u00a0charged the Texas Senate Education Committee with the task of examining these improper relationships and assess the role social media played in fostering these incidences, to seek\u00a0policy solutions to present at the 85th Legislature in 2017.Although the proliferation of social media and texting as classroom tools get blamed for\u00a0the increase in teacher-student sexual misconduct cases, the problem may run deeper. Dr. Ernest\u00a0Zarra, III, author of \u201cTeacher-Student Relationships: Crossing into the Emotional, Physical, and Sexual Realms,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0it\u00a0reflects a breakdown in society\u2019s moral fiber exacerbated by blurred boundaries between adults and students in an Internet age where underlying psychological factors often influence why some\u00a0adults form inappropriate bonds with students.The\u00a0TEA submitted\u00a0its 2018-19 legislative appropriations in August. They asked for $391,134 and three full-time employees (FTE), two investigators and one administrator. They\u00a0explained:\u00a0\u201cFor the past decade, there has been a steady increase in the number of inappropriate educator-student relationships reported to the Agency. When these cases are reported, the Agency investigates them as quickly and as efficiently as possible to ensure the safety of Texas children. In cases where inappropriate behavior is discovered, the Agency conducts an investigation to determine an appropriate sanction (if any) against the educator\u2019s certification, which may include revocation. As the caseload has increased, the number of investigators has remained the same over the past several years. This request will allow for the more efficient and timely investigation of these types of cases. It should be noted, however, that the Agency does not currently have authority to investigate or sanction non-certified educators, an issue that is worthy of consideration during the upcoming Legislative Session.\u201dTEA Director of Educator Investigations Doug Phillips\u00a0told the Texas Tribune:\u00a0\u201cNeedless to say, if we had two more investigators, we would be able to spread those cases out more and we would be able to get to those cases a little faster.\u201d He said: \u201cI have every reason to believe that that case number will continue to increase.\u201dBreitbart Texas reported Phillips voiced\u00a0concerns that many cases go\u00a0unreported or schools strike secret deals with offending educators,\u00a0squelching information. He told the Tribune\u00a0some superintendents handle the matter by not renewing a questionable teacher or coach\u2019s contract.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to non-renew a person or to let them just leave on their own than it is to terminate them for districts,\u201d Phillips said, noting legal costs mount when employees fight contract terminations.He has also pointed out the difficulties in prosecuting these cases\u00a0because of the way the law is written. Breitbart Texas reported:\u201cTexas Penal Code 21.12 considers improper relationships a second degree felony that can result in 2-20 years in prison. Phillips pointed out not all improper relationship cases are considered crimes. For example, a teacher-student sexual relationship where the student attends a different school district than where the teacher is employed, when sexual contact cannot be proven, and if\u00a0there is no sexual contact but where the adult initiates the solicitation of a romantic relationship (Texas Administrative Code 249.3).\u201dTEA investigations can end with the State Board of Educator Certification (SBEC) issuing\u00a0a punishment as light as a reprimand to\u00a0suspension, license surrender/revocation, or prison. Cases are sometimes closed because of lack of proof. Although the SBEC can sanction educators for improper relationships with students, those who avoid conviction can, theoretically, keep their teacher certifications.Buck Gilcrease, chair of\u00a0the Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA) and a Houston-area school district superintendent, asserted\u00a0the laws necessary to crack down on inappropriate relationships are \u201calready on the books,\u201d according to the Texas Tribune.\u201cI think most school districts and most employers of people where this happens have offered sufficient training,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cI personally feel it comes down to terrible, immoral actions done by those people.\u201dLast year,\u00a0TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe\u00a0told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe vast majority of our teachers are working in an ethical and moral manner each and every day.\u201d She stated, \u201cParents expect their children to be safe when they are at school.

Texas Supreme Court Justice John Devine disagreed with his fellow justices and wrote that the Court should have heard the case.The lawsuit was brought by Houston taxpayers before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion granting\u00a0same-sex marriage rights in\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges. The taxpayer lawsuit was an attempt to stop cities like Houston from granting employee benefits to same-sex couples who were married in a state that recognized gay marriage when Texas law did not. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and granted a temporary injunction blocking the City\u2019s actions.\u00a0The Obergefell decision was issued prior to the Court of Appeals hearing and was cited by the intermediate appellate court when it overturned the trial court\u2019s injunction.As reported by Breitbart Texas on September 4, Justice Devine issued a dissenting opinion which stated that while the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that same-sex couples may marry, the U.S. Constitution does not necessarily require cities to offer benefits to same-sex spouses of employees. While marriage may be a fundamental right, spousal benefits are not, he reasoned. He wrote that the same constitutional strict scrutiny does not apply to employment benefits.In their motion for rehearing, Petitioner/Plaintiff taxpayers argue that there is no \u201cfundamental right\u201d for married couples to receive taxpayer-funded benefits or subsidies. They urge that the Texas Supreme Court should instruct state courts to narrowly construe the\u00a0Obergefell\u00a0same-sex marriage ruling because the SCOTUS decision has no legal basis in the Constitution. They also argue that the ruling should be narrowly construed because it threatens the religious freedom of those who oppose homosexual behavior.The Petitioners write:[I]t is urgent that this Court step in and instruct the district court to narrowly construe the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015)\u2014and the urgency has only grown since we filed our brief on the merits. Justice Devine\u2019s dissent, along with recent rulings of federal courts that continue to abuse the judicial power by imposing ideologies that cannot be found anywhere in the Constitution, make it imperative for this Court to grant the petition for review and announce that the 5 courts of this State must construe Obergefell and similar rulings as narrowly as possible.One of the lawyers for the plaintiff taxpayers who also serves as the president of Texas Values, Jonathan Saenz said, \u201cWe urge the Texas Supreme Court to take up this case to bring justice to the Houston taxpayers who were robbed because of Mayor Annise Parker\u2019s illegal political agenda. Allowing Mayor Parker to change state law on taxpayer funded benefits by an executive order and bypass the Texas Legislature is embarrassing and unlawful. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell ruling was about requiring access to a same-sex marriage license. To now use that ruling to force private taxpayers to pay for same-sex benefits of government employees is judicial activism to the highest degree.\u201d\u201cWe are asking the Texas Supreme Court to bring justice to taxpayers whose dollars were sacrificed on Mayor Parker\u2019s altar of political correctness,\u201d\u00a0attorney and former Harris County Republican Party chairman Jared Woodfill told Breitbart Texas.\u00a0Woodfill explained, \u201cMayor Parker issued an executive order to go around the Texas Legislature and this violates the religious liberties of those who oppose same-sex marriage. It also tramples on the Tenth Amendment rights afforded to the Texas legislature and tramples on\u00a0the Legislature\u2019s power of the purse.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye). Statewide, the\u00a0DSHS recommends\u00a0testing for anyone with three Zika symptoms and all pregnant women who traveled to areas\u00a0with active Zika transmission, even if\u00a0they show no signs of the virus.Although there are no reports of\u00a0locally-spread Zika in Texas, these Rio Grand Valley counties at the state\u2019s southernmost tip\u00a0remain\u00a0at higher risk for the virus\u2019\u00a0transmission. This is based on the area\u2019s\u00a0experiences with local transmission of Dengue fever, a virus like Zika. Both are spread by the\u00a0Aedes aegypti mosquito, native to Texas. Cases of Dengue are most commonly reported from August through December.Public health\u00a0officials have long feared the Rio Grande Valley could be one of the first places hit by Zika in Texas. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston, told NBC DFW the alert is a good start, but more south Texas counties may need to be added.\u00a0\u201cI might consider expanding the area where we are going to do expanded Zika testing to Harris County as well as possibly Bexar County as well,\u201d\u00a0he said.In May, Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0on the threat Zika poses to the\u00a0Texas-Mexico border and Gulf Coast regions. The State remains on\u00a0high alert for the virus since August when the Miami outbreak occurred. Officials continue\u00a0to roll out\u00a0preparations to lessen Zika\u2019s impact should it spread via\u00a0local mosquitoes.\u00a0In February, Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0the DSHS\u00a0feared\u00a0such a \u201ctransmission cycle\u201d could happen in the Lone Star State.As of October 3, Texas reported 218 Zika cases, all associated with travel Zika-infected regions. This count includes 13 pregnant women, two infants infected before birth, and two people who contracted the virus through sexual contact from partners infected outside the United States.The State\u00a0accounted for 75 women in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Zika Pregnancy Registry. This includes the aforementioned 13 pregnant women plus pregnant women and newborns who test Zika positive\u00a0but are not listed as Zika cases because they have no symptoms or because the infection can not clearly be identified as Zika.DSHS continues to advise\u00a0pregnant women to delay travel to areas where Zika\u00a0is actively spreading. The department also cautions against unprotected sexual contact with partners who recently traveled to active Zika regions since the virus spreads through sexual transmission.People can take simple precautions to prevent the mosquito bites, in general, and forestall the possible spread of Zika\u2013apply an EPA-approved insect repellent, wear long pants and shirts that cover exposed skin, use air conditioning indoors, keep\u00a0window and door screens in good condition, and remove standing water from around the home.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, CDC, Dengue Fever, Dr. John Hellerstedt, Dr. Peter J.

One of these exemptions is known as the \u201clocal option homestead exemption.\u201dThe Residence Homestead Exemption allows a governing body of a political\u00a0subdivision to exempt from ad valorem taxation, a percentage of the market value of the residence homestead of a married or unmarried adult, including one living alone. The amount of the exemption may not exceed 20 percent and may not be less than $5,000 unless the Texas Legislature prescribes other monetary restrictions.\u00a0An eligible adult is entitled to receive other applicable exemptions provided by law, such as the homestead exemption with statewide application pertaining to ad valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes, the plaintiffs argue.The Legislature codified the local option homestead exemption in the\u00a0Texas Tax Code.The lawsuit states that a joint resolution adopted by the 84th Legislature in 2015 (S.J.R. 1) amended the Texas Tax Code\u00a0and provides that the \u201cgoverning body of a school district, municipality, or county that adopted an exemption under Subsection (n) for the 2014 tax year may not reduce the amount of or repeal the exemption.\u201d The provision expires December 31, 2019. It became effective on January 1, 2015.The plaintiff taxpayers argue that \u201cIn adopting S.B. 1, the Legislature intended to prevent school districts, municipalities, and counties from reducing the amount of or repealing local option homestead exemptions that they had adopted for the 2014 tax year for use in subsequent years.\u201dMoreover, they urge the legislative intent as evidenced in the Bill Analysis of S.B. 1 states that\u00a0\u201c[a]ny local taxing units that currently offer the optional homestead exemption must maintain the current exemptions offered for 10 years.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0bill would prohibit a school district, municipality, or county that has adopted an optional percentage homestead exemption for the 2014 tax year under Section 11.13(n) Tax Code from reducing or repealing the exemption for a period extending through the end of tax year 2019.\u201dThis legislative intent was confirmed in a letter from Senator Jane Nelson (R-Flower Mound). Sen. Nelson serves as the Chair of the Senate Finance Committee.On March 17, 2016, the Office of the Attorney General of Texas issued a formal opinion (KP-0072) that held that \u201cany repeal of or reduction in the amount of a local option homestead exemption by a school district, municipality, or county in 2015 would have no effect under subsection 11.13(n-1)\u2019s express terms.\u201dTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton has intervened in the lawsuit against Kilgore ISD saying\u00a0that the district violated state law and the Texas Constitution when it repealed the local option homestead exemption. Paxton filed a similar intervention against the White Deer Independent School District on September 15.In a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas, AG Paxton said,\u00a0\u201cLocal governments cannot be allowed to simply ignore laws that they do not like. This is a blatant attempt by a school district to take away from Texas homeowners, without their vote or consent, what rightfully belongs to them \u2013 their own money. I am confident that the local taxpayers and the State will prevail in this lawsuit and the suits to come.\u201dUpon the filing of the lawsuit, SB 1 author Senator Jane Nelson said: \u201cSB 1 clearly stated that the tax relief approved last session was over and above any local option homestead exemption. Implementation of the law needs to be uniformly enforced across the state.\u201dTexas State Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe 22 ISDs that cancelled their optional homestead exemption are denying their own taxpayers the homestead exemption approved by voters and the Legislature. They are totally wrong and the courts will order them to reverse their illegal action.\u201d Bettencourt served as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector prior to becoming a state senator.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

At least one of the robbers displayed a firearm, according to Montgomery County Police Reporter\u2019s Scott Engle. One of Turner\u2019s employees responded by pulling an AK-47 semi-automatic rifle from behind the counter. The gunman fired at the store employees and a firefight ensued. At least three employees were said to have fired weapons at the robbery suspects.The suspect who began shooting was struck and killed in the gun fight. The other three suspects escaped\u00a0in a white Dodge Charger. Police found the Charger not far from the scene of the robbery. The suspects in the failed robbery attempt had abandoned the car and remain at large, Engle reported.Police have not yet released the identity of the deceased suspect.The attempted robbery took place on Monday afternoon at about 12:30 p.m.Turner\u2019s attorney, E. Tay Bond, spoke with the Conroe Courier\u2019s Catherine Dominguez. \u201cYou always have a right to defend yourself, especially when the robber shoots at you.\u201d Bond confirmed that Turner keeps an AK-47 in the store for defensive purposes.The AK-47 rifle is manufactured in both automatic and semi-automatic models. In a semi-automatic weapon you must pull the trigger each time you want to fire. An automatic weapon will fire as long as you hold the trigger, until you run out of ammunition.Conroe Police Department\u2019s Lt.

At that time, Dominguez reported, one of the employees grabbed a shotgun and the would-be robbers said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got guns. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201dThe store employees were\u00a0able to successfully stop the robbery and protect the lives of other\u00a0employees and customers who were threatened by the armed gunmen.A search for the suspects, which included support from a Drug Enforcement Agency helicopter, was not successful and the police manhunt continues.

Cristo Rey, New Mexico, were searching for a group of illegal immigrants who had just crossed the border near Puerto de Anapra, Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey is located in the extreme southeastern tip of the state and a few miles west of El Paso, Texas.Agents requested air support from a helicopter assigned to the El Paso Branch of Air and Marine Operations (AMO), according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials by Breitbart Texas Monday afternoon. The aircrew responded and used its \u201cforward looking infrared camera\u201d (FLIR) to locate the immigrants who were hiding in the darkness of a near moonless night.The aircrew guided agents to the location of the immigrants. One of the illegal aliens who had been hiding in the brush suddenly ran toward one of the agents. As the agent grabbed the man and attempted to take him into custody, a fight broke out. As the agent was wrestling with the man, both were \u201churtled over a six-foot ledge,\u201d officials stated. The agent\u2019s head struck a rock and he was temporarily disabled. The suspect fled the scene.The aircrew from the AMO helicopter used its spotlight follow the suspect and guide other agents to his location. A \u201cgovernment issued electronic control device\u201d was eventually used to disable the man. He was taken into custody without further incident.Agents from the El Paso Sector Horse Patrol Unit, with the help of the aircrew, searched, found, and captured the remaining illegal immigrants.The agent who was injured in the fall from the ledge was treated at the scene and then transported via helicopter air ambulance to the Las Palmas Medical Center in El Paso.The illegal alien who allegedly assaulted the Border Patrol agent was taken into custody and turned over to the FBI. He faces the possibility of prosecution on a felony charge of Assault on a Federal Officer. It is expected he will be processed for Expedited Removal following his prosecution by the Department of Justice.The injured agent was treated released by the hospital. No information was available on the nationality of this suspect or the others traveling with him.There has been a significant increase in assaults against Border Patrol agents by illegal aliens during FY 2016, according to CBP officials. As of the end of August, the latest numbers available, 404 Border Patrol agents have been assaulted. This compares to 360 agents who were assaulted in the same period of FY 2015. That is an increase of 12 percent. Assaults against all CBP law enforcement officers are up by 23 percent when comparing the same time period.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The shopping center was less than 150 meters from the Reynosa City Hall and less than 300 yards from the Texas border.The Mexican Marines requested air support and additional troops to ensure that the man they had spotted was Comandante Toro. Cartel lookouts noticed the activity by military personnel and sounded the alarm, setting off an escape operation by Gulf Cartel forces. A military helicopter chased and shot at a black Nissan Pathfinder that tried to flee the area at a high rate of speed. The shots from the helicopter disabled the truck forcing the men inside to run out into the nearby shops and buildings in an effort to blend in with the crowd. The gunmen running into the market caused panic among the local shoppers.Cartel lookouts received orders to hide and blend among the shoppers while military personnel set up a perimeter around the downtown area and began a search for the gunman they believed to be Toro. Meanwhile, the real Toro managed to sneak out to safety. Breitbart Texas has spoken with law enforcement officials who revealed that some military deserters make up part of Toro\u2019s personal security detail. The former personnel are familiar with military tactics, apparently helping Toro avoid capture.In an effort to confuse military forces, cartel members began to stack tires that were then set on fire. Cartel trucks drove around the city distributing tires while gunmen stole various vehicles from unsuspecting motorists. The vehicles were used to park along main roads and set on fire to create additional roadblocks.In the afternoon, citizen journalists began to speak about the capture and eventual release of a cartel commander named \u201cBeto\u201d or \u201cBetito\u201d who has been described as Toro\u2019s relative. The information of his capture has not been confirmed or disproven by authorities.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

The post was eventually deleted by Facebook but not before it received over 2,000,000 views, nearly 10,000 reactions and nearly 28,000 shares.In her post, she said, \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to a little boy from the Waco area.\u201d She continued saying she would like to \u201cshow you all what he and his friends think is cool to do to a dogs body.

She had one blue eye and one brown eye.\u201d He said that distinctive eye color mismatch is not that common in her breed of dog.\u201cI froze up,\u201d Plant said of his reaction to the video. He said his girlfriend had to take his phone away so he could not watch any more of the video.\u201cI was definitely horrified, to say the least,\u201d a very emotional Plant said. Rogers asked Plant what might lead someone to do something like this. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what it is, but whatever it is, that person needs help,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey need help bad because you shouldn\u2019t do stuff\u00a0like that\u2013not to anything, ever.\u201dEllie would have turned one-year-old in November.This case is being investigated by detectives from the Williamson County Sheriff\u2019s Office.In August, Breitbart Texas reported on a Baylor University football player who also got in trouble for animal cruelty after allegedly abusing his dog over a \u201cpotty training\u201d incident.

This is the latest setback to the president\u2019s attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and the rule of law.\u201dAs reported by Breitbart Texas on June 23, the nation\u2019s highest court left in place a block of President Obama\u2019s unlawful executive amnesty dictate. The eight-member court has a vacancy left by the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. On that date, the Court stalled the federal government\u2019s executive amnesty order with a 4-4 vote. The tied decision in United States v. Texas, et al. left in place the lower court decision.These decisions highlight the importance of the upcoming presidential election in the country.\u00a0While the president may have lost this round in his over-reaching use of executive power, the next president will select a replacement for conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia died in mid-February while staying at a ranch in west Texas, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas at the time. Republicans have refused to vote on Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart News.As\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas, the Fifth Circuit issued a ruling in November 2015\u00a0effectively putting the brakes on\u00a0President Obama\u2019s November 2014 executive amnesty order.\u00a0The Fifth Circuit ruled that the lower federal district court did not err in granting a\u00a0halt to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program. U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen previously issued the order\u00a0stopping the president\u2019s actions, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas.President Obama used executive action to dictate that the DAPA program (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) be implemented. Then-Attorney General Greg Abbott (now Texas Governor) filed suit challenging the executive order and led a coalition of 26 states to fight the effort. The case involved the issues of the proper scope of presidential power to bypass Congress, the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws.As\u00a0noted\u00a0by Breitbart News, the Court declined to rule on the notice-and-comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA requires a time period for notice to and comment from the public before issuing rules that create public policy mirroring law. A ruling that the federal government violated the provisions would have provided for transparency and government accountability, he wrote.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The complaint asked for declaratory and injunctive relief.ICANN has always been overseen by the U.S. Commerce Department but the federal government\u2019s contract with ICANN was set to expire on Friday, September 30. The attorneys general of these states urged that the \u201cproposed actions are unlawful and should be temporarily restrained and enjoined.\u201dTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton was joined by\u00a0Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, and Nevada Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt. The lawsuit was filed in Texas in U.S. District Court Southern District of Texas, Galveston Division. Named in the lawsuit as defendants were: the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA); the United States of America; the United States Department of Commerce; the Secretary of Commerce; and the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information.The federal government\u2019s goal was to abandon NTIA\u2019s option rights under its contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN), cancel its cooperative agreement with Verisign, Inc., and delegate its authority to approve changes to the Internet\u2019s root zone file.Texas Attorney General spokesman Marc Rylander said, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with the ruling. It\u2019s a dire day in our country when the President is allowed to unilaterally give away America\u2019s pioneering role in ensuring that the internet remains a place where free expression can flourish. \u00a0We will continue to weigh our options as the suit moves forward.\u201dThe federal lawsuit argued that the Internet hand-over \u201cviolates the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution by giving away government property without congressional authorization.\u201d\u00a0 The attorneys general filed the lawsuit after Congress failed to act to stop the planned turn-over.When the lawsuit was filed, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, \u201cTrusting authoritarian regimes to ensure the continued freedom of the Internet is lunacy. The president does not have the authority to simply give away America\u2019s pioneering role in ensuring that the Internet remains a place where free expression can flourish.\u201d Arizona AG Mark Brnovich told Breitbart Texas that it was unfortunate that Congress had not addressed the issue.The Arizona AG said that the First Amendment was in jeopardy and noted that other countries may resent our nation\u2019s constitutional liberties. He warned, \u201cI am very concerned that they will no longer be guaranteed.\u201d He said other countries and \u201cauthoritarian regimes\u201d \u201cunfortunately, do not share our view.\u201dBreitbart News reported\u00a0that Obama\u2019s move to hand-over control of Internet domains would give interests in China, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea an ability to have authoritarian control over online speech. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are said to be at risk. The Chinese government banned online news reporting and bloggers who criticize the government can be charged with a crime; even posts on social media are limited. It was reported that Russia and China are said to be working together towards the goal of more censorship of the Internet. Turkey has an outright ban on social media and it is a crime to insult the president. Public flogging and jail sentences are used in Saudi Arabia to punish those who offend the government. The article also reports that Turkey is often seen as the world leader in blocking Twitter accounts and Saudi Arabia has about 400,000 websites blocked. North Korea\u2019s \u201cInternet\u201d is essentially only for government propaganda and surveillance.Facebook, Google, Twitter, have all urged Congress to support the cede of control by the U.S. government of the Internet\u2019s technical management to the global community, as reported by Breitbart News and Reuters.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The arrest came after a lengthy Homeland Security investigation into a Los Zetas drug distribution and money laundering operation that reached from the Texas border into Waco, court documents obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed. Trevi\u00f1o went before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey C. Manske who ordered that he be held without bond pending a detention hearing at a later date. On Friday, Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s lawyer Rafael De La Garza asked for the detention hearing to the held at a later date in order to get additional witnesses and evidence.The federal case against Trevi\u00f1o deals primarily with the cash smuggling and laundering worth millions for the Los Zetas drug cartel. Breitbart Texas has learned through court records that in 1994, federal agents arrested Trevino in Laredo in connection with the smuggling of close to $48,000 from Texas into Mexico. In border cities, drug cartels have historically smuggled drugs and immigrants north while smuggling proceeds south using various means. For his role in the cash smuggling operation, Trevi\u00f1o pleaded guilty and received a 5 year prison sentence. In recent years, Trevi\u00f1o had been operating in Laredo, Tamaulipas and in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon for the Los Zetas cartel. In 2012, Trevi\u00f1o was set to take over the Monterrey Plaza for Los Zetas but was apprehended by Mexican authorities who then released him on a technicality after a judge ruled that the case lacked evidence. Despite Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s role as a top Zeta, Mexican authorities do not have an open case against him in Nuevo Leon. Trevi\u00f1o had inherited the control of the Los Zetas from his relative, Miguel Angel \u201cEl 40 or Z40\u201d Trevino Morales. The Trevino faction has since been known as the Cartel Del Noreste while the other faction has assumed the name \u201cVieja Escuela Z\u201d or Old School Z as well as Grupo Bravo.As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, for more than 11 months two rival factions of the Los Zetas cartel have been fighting for control of lucrative drug trafficking routes and territories. The fighting between the two factions has resulted in a massive spike in violence throughout the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.  The Los Zetas cartel began as an enforcement wing and personal guard for the then leader of the Gulf Cartel Osiel Cardenas. At the time of their creation, Los Zetas were made up of military deserters and Mexican federal cops who switched sides seeking higher wages and power. In 2010, Los Zetas broke away from the Gulf Cartel setting off a war that continues to this day.

Nicks said the time is also spent building new fire stations, adding that the latest complaint is simply one of many attacks against unions.\u201cLet me be clear, this lawsuit is a state-wide attack on all public sector employee groups, not just the AFA,\u201d said Nicks in a statement on the association\u2019s website. He argues police, fire and employee associations use release time similarly across the state.Under the current agreement, the AFA is allowed up to 6,600 hours of annual release time, 1,000 hours of which may be carried over to the next calendar year. More than 2,000 hours of release time is earmarked for the AFA president.The plaintiffs say release time costs Austin residents million of dollars and is funded through city tax revenue including property tax. The agreement receives almost no oversight from the City, as the AFA is not compulsory to report how the taxpayer time is spent.\u201cNeither the AFA, its President, nor any of its members are contractually required to provide an accounting to Austin for how they use \u2026 release time,\u201d the lawsuit states.Nicks told Breitbart Texas that he\u2019s open to more transparency in regards to how the practice is accounted for, as long as it \u201cadds value and isn\u2019t so cumbersome that it prevents\u201d the fire association from handling its business.\u201cAllegations that there\u2019s no transparency aren\u2019t true,\u201d he said. With the exception of his position, firefighters are required to submit request forms to the fire chief\u2019s office that detail how their release time is used. \u201cThere is that accountability,\u201d Nicks said.In 2015, the Goldwater Institute filed a similar lawsuit against the City of Phoenix, this time involving police unions. The courts ruled in the institute\u2019s favor, saying, \u201cgovernment employees cannot be paid their government salary and sent to work for their union.\u201dThe current lawsuit is awaiting a response from the City with a predicted deadline of October 10.Julie Wilson is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.Breitbart Texas, Austin Fire Association, budget, City of Austin, firefighters, Goldwater Institute, Government unions, Police, subsidies, taxes, taxpayers, Texas Public Policy Foundation, Travis CountyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

When the agents took the subject to the Border Patrol station for processing they discovered the Mexican national had been previously deported after his release from a Virginia prison, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman Dennis Smith.Gomez-Vidal had been convicted in a Prince William County, Virginia, circuit court in January 2012 on a charge of felony carnal knowledge of a minor. He was sentenced to five years in prison and was subsequently removed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) agents.Four days later, agents assigned to the Eagle Pass station arrested Hector Edmundo Pinto-Machorro, 63 after he had illegally re-entered the country. The Guatemalan national was taken to the station for processing and agents learned that Pinto-Machorro had been previously deported for a sexual offense against a child in San Antonio, the CBP statement revealed.The Guatemalan man was convicted by a San Antonio district court on a charge of indecency with a child including sexual contact in February 2016. He was subsequently processed for removal by ERO agents.\u201cThis is another excellent example of our agents\u2019 expertise and vigilance in preventing dangerous criminals from entering the United States,\u201d Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J.

Four people died. Others were seriously injured.Wynn and Brown asserted that Salvant had\u00a0no authority over Couch because the case, which originated in the juvenile court system, should have transferred to a civil court when the teen turned of legal age, 19, and not to a\u00a0criminal court. They argued\u00a0Salvant, a criminal court judge, prosecuted adult felony cases\u00a0and, because of that, his decisions were invalid. The attorneys said their client should be released from jail.Couch\u2019s\u00a0case\u00a0transferred automatically from the juvenile to the adult court system on his 19th birthday in April. According to the Fort Worth paper, Salvant was randomly assigned to the case.Wynn and Brown claimed\u00a0Couch could potentially sue Salvant for wrongfully jailing him. Breitbart Texas reported the recusal motion stated\u00a0any determination the court acted out of its jurisdiction could result in a civil claim by the teen. It contended the judge would have a\u00a0financial interest in the outcome of such litigation, leaving the court\u2019s impartiality and personal bias to be questioned.In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Tarrant County prosecutor Richard Alpert countered their argument by pointing out Couch\u2019s\u00a0case ceased to be considered a civil one when it transferred from juvenile to felony court. Alpert called the defense\u2019s argument a \u201cnovel theory.\u201d He said: \u201cTheir argument is based on a hypothetical argument that they may sue the judge. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dTwo days later, Evans denied the motion to remove Salvant from the case. Couch will remain in jail, serving the 720 day sentence Salvant ordered in April. The time reflects\u00a0180 day terms for each of the four individuals Couch killed in the drunk driving crash. He\u00a0is\u00a0scheduled for release in 2018.Couch was 16-years-old at the time of the accident. Wynn and Brown\u00a0defended\u00a0him in the high-profile trial, attributing the minor\u2019s reckless behavior to \u201caffluenza,\u201d an inability to distinguish right from wrong\u00a0because of a\u00a0coddled, affluent upbringing. The prosecution sought 20 years in prison but a\u00a0lenient juvenile judge doled out the\u00a010 year probation sentence. This also included\u00a0some rehab and counseling.Late last year, authorities believed Couch violated the terms of his probation and alleged\u00a0his mother, Tonya Couch, helped him flee the country. The two vanished, resulting in\u00a0an international search. Authorities quickly found the pair in Mexico. They were deported back to Texas.Salvant also presides over the case of Couch\u2019s mother. She awaits trial on felony charges of money laundering and hindering the apprehension of a felon, her son Ethan. Weeks\u00a0before the two disappeared, she purportedly withdrew $30,000 from a personal bank account.\u00a0Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0her attorneys recently revealed she\u00a0is indigent. They petitioned for\u00a0court-appointed status so they may continue serving as the elder Couch\u2019s\u00a0legal defense. If this motion is granted, the taxpayers will foot her legal expenses. Salvant set a tentative February 2017 trial date.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Affluenza Teen, Ethan Couch, Fort Worth, Judge David Evans, Judge Wayne Salvant, Reagan Wynn, Scott Brown, Tarrant CountyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The attempted robbery occurred at the Jones Road store at about 9 p.m. Friday night, according to KHOU CBS11.The gun owner, who is legally licensed to carry a handgun drew his weapon and entered the store as the would-be robbers were demanding cash from the store employees. He demanded the three suspects drop their weapons and get down on the ground.He then held the suspects at gunpoint while Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies were called to the scene. When the deputies arrived they took the three failed robbery suspects into custody.No shots were fired and no one was injured in the incident.KHOU stated the deputies praised the LTC licensee for his actions in stopping the robbery before anyone was hurt. Deputies said they do not; however, recommend that people take this action as it could cause a shootout and someone could get hurt.The three suspects will likely face felony charges of Aggravated Robbery with a deadly weapon in one of Harris County\u2019s State District Courts. No bond information is available at this time on the suspects who were taken to the Harris County Jail for processing.Texas law allows a person with a LTC license to carry a handgun openly or concealed. The law also allows a person to use deadly force, or the threat of deadly force, to protect their own life or the life of others.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The two-sided legislation hopes to minimize negative interactions by addressing how both sides engage with each other.\u201cThere is no home team or visiting team. We must all come together to develop the best strategies to improve relations and trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve,\u201d said Whitmire in a press release. \u201cIncreased training and education for both peace officers and our students will help foster positive relations and interactions.\u201dWhitmire\u00a0told\u00a0San Antonio News Radio WOAI: \u201cYou can\u2019t win on the streets when you have been pulled over by an officer, if you don\u2019t follow his or her instructions, it\u2019s just that simple.\u201dHe noted young people may not be hearing that message at home. Whitmire said the course could include police and community leaders talking with kids about what is a police stop, what are their rights in such a situation, as well as the rights of police officers. The goal is to find the best ways to affect a positive outcome on both sides.The bill actually would\u00a0charge the\u00a0State Board of Education (SBOE) with establishing the curriculum guidelines for ninth graders to learn about law enforcement duties and strengthen their knowledge base on successful interactions.On Friday,\u00a0Larance Coleman, political director for Whitmire, told Breitbart Texas\u00a0the bill would become part of Texas Education Code under Section 28.025,\u00a0making the course a\u00a0requirement to receive a high school diploma. If passed,\u00a0this legislation would be the first of its kind in the state.Coleman underscored\u00a0the bill remains in its earliest stages. Whitmire made the\u00a0announcement to float the concept and solicit feedback. He\u00a0will submit a draft\u00a0in mid-November for debate in preparation for the 85th Legislature that convenes in January 2017.The Senate Criminal Justice Committee next meets in Austin on October 4. Whitmire asked members to\u00a0review statewide law enforcement efforts that engage community leaders and increase their involvement in communities, recommend ways\u00a0to reduce\u00a0the number of injuries and deaths to or by law enforcement, study the dangers to police officers, and examine the collection and distribution of threat assessment data.This bill follows recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa and Charlotte. It also comes in the wake of\u00a0the deadly ambush of\u00a0four Dallas police officers and one Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) agent protecting Black Lives Matter protesters on July 7. Gunman\u00a0Micah X. Johnson\u00a0shot the five officers towards the end of the\u00a0demonstration. Nine other law enforcement agents were injured.Whitmire also said\u00a0there were no winners in the Sandra Bland case. \u201cIf either one of those individuals would have taken a deep breath, deescalated things,\u201d he told WOAI. \u201cShe lost her life, unfortunately, he ruined his career.\u201dBland\u00a0committed\u00a0suicide\u00a0in a\u00a0Houston-area jail cell days after being pulled over by a Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper where a confrontation ensued following Bland\u2019s refusal to put out her cigarette at the request of the officer. He was later\u00a0fired\u00a0and indicted on a misdemeanor perjury charge.Whitmire authored the historic House Bill 2398, the 2013 law that\u00a0decriminalized truancy. It\u00a0requires schools to take common sense steps in addressing the deeper issues behind a student\u2019s habitual failure to attend school (FTAS), including homelessness, chronic illness, or unidentified special education needs.

Crime scene photographs of some of the victims revealed that the kidnapping victims died with handcuffs in their hands.The gunmen are believed to be part of the Cartel Del Noreste faction of the Los Zetas, who as Breitbart Texas has been reporting on for more than 11 months, has been at war with a rival faction called Vieja Escuela Z or Grupo Bravo. The fighting between the two factions has led to almost daily kidnappings, executions and gun battles.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

The gunmen managed to steal an ambulance that they used to transport their injured comrade. During the attack, the gunmen are believed to have used machine guns, grenade launchers and .50 caliber rifles; all of those weapons are considered illegal under Mexican law. That country\u2019s weapon\u2019s law make it virtually impossible for average citizens to legally obtain firearms.During a televised conference, Mexican Army Commander Alfredo Duarte Mujica identified the Julio Oscar \u201cEl Kevin\u201d Ortiz Vega. The gunman was being transported from Badiraguato in a convoy of two hummers with 17 soldiers escorting the ambulance with Ortiz Vega on board. Sinaloa State Governor Mario Lopez Valdez and his staff have publicly linked the Sinaloa Cartel to the attack. They have named the sons of famed drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman Loera, the currently jailed leader of the Sinaloa cartel. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, El Chapo is currently fighting his extradition to the U.S. to face multiple drug trafficking, money laundering, murder and other charges. On Friday night, the Governor of Sinaloa Mario Lopez Valdez took to Twitter to dispel the rumors that the city was under a curfew due to the spike in cartel violence. In addition to Lopez condemning the attack, Mexico\u2019s Secretary of the Interior Miguel Angel Osorio Chong and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have also taken to social media to condemn the attack and vowing to bring to justice those responsible.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

She said he\u00a0later dropped her off at her home and demanded she not tell anyone of the incident.That didn\u2019t keep the teenager from telling her sister at the time. The girl\u2019s mother was not made aware of the incident until months later and that\u2019s when she alerted authorities.Gonzales reportedly told police he never raped the girl, but following his arrest, a 50 year-old woman told police she experienced a sexual assault with the illegal immigrant as well.The woman said Gonzales grabbed her hand and put it on the crotch of his pants in the summer of last year. Like the rape, he has denied the incident.ICE officials told Breitbart Texas they had requested that local law enforcement notify them before releasing the illegal immigrant.\u201cICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of criminal aliens and other individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security,\u201d a spokesman for ICE told Breitbart Texas. \u201cAliens convicted of crimes involving violence are among ICE\u2019s highest priority for removal from the country.\u201dAs of days ago, Gonzales was still being held in the Jefferson Parish Detention Center.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

His action follows the rejection of a proposal announced previously where Texas officials demanded a certification that the refugees were not a security threat and a limit on the number of refugees to the original 2016 plan.\u201cTexas has repeatedly requested that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence provide assurances that refugees resettled in Texas will not pose a security threat, and that the number of refugees resettled in Texas would not exceed the State\u2019s original allocation in fiscal year 2016 \u2013 both of which have been denied by the federal government,\u201d Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cAs a result, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. As governor, I will continue to prioritize the safety of all Texans and urge the federal government to overhaul this severely broken system.\u201dTHHSC Spokesman Bryan Bryan Black told Breitbart Texas on Friday afternoon, \u201cSince we have not received federal approval of our plan, we are moving forward with our transition out of the Refugee Resettlement Program. After today, the current plan will no longer be in effect, and we will begin exiting the program, with benefits and services ending on Jan. 31, 2017.\u201dTHHSC sent a letter to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement detailing the State\u2019s concerns, Breitbart Texas reported on September 21. That letter states:In follow up to our request for approval of our application for an amended State Plan, I write to express the state of Texas\u2019 intentions should you not unconditionally approve our application by September 30, 2016.The 2016 State Plan will no longer be current and continue in effect after September 30, 2016. That date is quickly approaching, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement has not yet approved our application for an amended State Plan. If you do not approve our State Plan as amended by September 30, 2016, we will interpret your silence as a rejection of the application. If our application is rejected -whether explicitly or by silence \u2013 the Health and Human Services Commission will be unable to certify that its State Plan is current and in effect, and will exit the Refugee Resettlement Program. We will notify contractors and impacted stakeholders that services and benefits will be provided for 120 days beyond October 1, 2016, or until January\u2019 31, 2017.These requests were rejected by the federal government, the governor\u2019s office stated.Governor Abbott previously said the federal refugee resettlement plan is riddled with serious problems that create threats to the country. Breitbart Texas previously reported on testimony before Congress from some of the President\u2019s top security advisors. The officials stated they believe that terrorists would attempt to infiltrate the refugee resettlement program.\u201cWe have certainly seen terrorist groups talk about, think about, exactly what you are describing, Mr. Smith,\u201d Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Nicholas J. Rasmussen told Rep. Lamar Smith. \u201cTrying to use available programs to get people not only into the United States, but into western European countries as well. So we know that they aspire to do that.\u201d\u00a0This testimony was made prior to the terrorist attacks in Paris where at least one Syrian refugee was involved,\u00a0according to\u00a0an article by Breitbart London.Earlier this month, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul reiterated that there is currently no way to properly vet Syrian refugees. His comments came in Houston during a meeting of the Downtown Houston Pachyderm Club, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\u201cIf there is no data to check, there is no data to check,\u201d McCaul said at the Thursday lunch meeting of local Republican activists. The chairman said he arrived at this conclusion after talking with some of the top security officials in the country.Texas is leading the United States in refugee resettlement, Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this year.

San Francisco 49ers backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s choice of not standing for the anthem is a preferred option, he suggested. \u201c[O]f all the ways you could protest, you could throw a bomb, you could shoot a gun, you could throw a punch, you could start a protest, you could try to start a riot, you could shoot somebody, he took a knee.\u201dThe 58-year-0ld native of Pittsburgh and host of Shark Tank went on to say that Kaepernick\u2019s failure to stand for \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d initiated a \u201chuge conversation about what it means to be an American\u201d and \u201cwhat it means to salute the flag.\u201d If any of the Mavericks choose to follow in the steps of the embattled 49ers quarterback they will be breaking the rules set out by the National Basketball Association. Players could face penalty or suspension for violating the mandate. The NFL has no such rule.Oklahoma City Thunder guard Victor Oladipo said that he expects NBA players to follow the trend set by Kaepernick and now others in the NFL and throughout professional and amateur sports. \u201dOh, no question. I truly believe it will,\u201d he stated in an interview with Complex Sports. \u201cBecause at the end of the day it\u2019s a sport, and people are gonna be looking at some guys in the NBA to see what they\u2019re gonna do as well.

They admitted to transporting more than 500 immigrants over a 10-year period beginning in April 2016. The couple would pick up the aliens after they crossed the border near Laredo, Texas. They would then transport them to a stash house in the Austin area. They would ultimately move them on to their final destination in other states including Alabama, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida.Family members of the smuggled aliens deposited money into bank accounts that would be funneled to the couple. They would keep a portion of the proceeds and forward the balance to their partners in Mexico. As Breitbart Texas has previously reported, the Los Zetas drug cartel largely controls drug and human smuggling in the Laredo area.\u201cHomeland Security Investigations special agents often investigate complex financial schemes in order to disrupt and dismantle the operations of transnational criminal organizations,\u201d Special Agent in Charge Shane Folden, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), San Antonio, said in a written statement. \u201cThese investigations deprive the criminal organizations from enjoying the benefits of the illicit proceeds, and prevent them from furthering the ongoing criminal enterprise. We will continue to aggressively investigate fraudulent financial schemes that put in jeopardy the integrity of our financial system.\u201dIn addition to the prison sentences, the federal government has seized their residence in Cedar Creek, Texas and $106,390 in cash on the day the couple was arrested. An additional $71,000 was found from 10 other bank accounts and will be applied to a $1,173,000 judgement levied against the couple. They were fined $5,000 each. Valdez Menchaca initially filed for public representation as an indigent. The judge ruled she had the assets to fund her own defense and ordered her to pay a $2,709 assessment to reimburse the government for the cost of her defense.The couple was arrested on April, 2016, following an investigation by HSI agents and the Austin Police Department.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The Tamaulipas government revealed that three gunmen died in the gun battle\u2013but also found the bodies of three victims who appeared to have been previously executed.\u00a0Less than 24 hours before the fight, the streets in Ciudad Victoria were once again filled with blood when a team of gunmen pulled up to a house asking for an organized crime member. Information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Tamaulipas government revealed that after failing to find their rival, the gunmen executed four men that were inside the house. The victims were identified as 56-year-old Raul Avalos Guerra, a Taco restaurant owner; 35-year-old local businessman Antonio Sanchez Soto, 24-year-old Taco stand worker Raul Alejandro Sanchez Alfaro and 19-year-old Daniel Antonio Avalos Aladro, a baseball player for the Los Broncos team in Reynosa.As Breitbart Texas has been reporting for more than 11 months, two rival factions of the Los Zetas cartel have been at war over lucrative drug trafficking routes and territories. One of the factions under the name \u201cGrupo Bravo\u201d or \u201cVieja Escuela Z\u201d has been trying to push out the faction known as Cartel Del Noreste.On Wednesday the bloodshed continued when just four hours after the execution of the six men, another team of gunmen killed two who had been eating at a local taco restaurant. The attack took place at the El Jarocho restaurant where one of the victims identified as 32-year-old Ricardo Tadeo Monroy Cruz died at the scene. The other victim was identified as Fernando Avial Cruz who tried to run away but was fatally wounded as he ran to a nearby hotel. Cruz died at a local hospital.On Wednesday afternoon yet another execution took place killing a 16-year-old teenager. Gunmen stormed a house in the Luis Echeverria neighborhood where they shot Eber Obviel Mu\u00f1oz Mascorro five times. Another teenager at the house was also hit but he managed to run seeking help and medical attention.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

However, the district\u2019s superintendent blames the State\u00a0for its woes.This decision came days after Marlin ISD\u00a0joined a parent-led lawsuit against the 2015-16 State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and voted to appeal last year\u2019s test scores.The TEA could have shut down Marlin ISD and bused nearly 1,000 students to one of four other schools located 10 to 25 miles away. Instead, they opted to change\u00a0leadership after the district failed to meet accountability standards for five consecutive years. The State measures student progress, closing\u00a0performance gaps, post-secondary readiness, and student achievement. Districts must pass three out of the four to meet State standards.\u00a0Although Marlin ISD\u00a0saw incremental progress in its middle and high schools last year, the elementary school did not meet any of the four criteria,\u00a0KWTX reported.Unsatisfactory ratings landed\u00a0Marlin ISD on the TEA\u2019s Public Education Grant (PEG) list from 2011 through\u00a02016-17. Its\u00a0three campuses were labeled low performers because of poor test scores or other unacceptable metrics. In 2015, the district\u00a0lost its TEA accreditation. To remain\u00a0open, Marlin ISD officials\u00a0signed an agreement allowing the State to replace the elected board of trustees with an appointed board of managers if the district\u00a0did not meet academic accountability ratings this year.Breitbart Texas obtained a September 23 letter Education Commissioner Mike Morath sent to Marlin Superintendent Michael Seabolt. In it, Morath said he will\u00a0announce the board of managers and superintendent positions in a future correspondence. The\u00a0Waco Tribune reported\u00a0Seabolt believes this may happen in December.Seabolt\u00a0is the fourth superintendent in five years, brought in last year to try to turn the district around. His\u00a0contract expires in November and he\u00a0does not know if the TEA will keep or replace him. In the letter, Morath named the\u00a0district\u2019s existing TEA monitor, Dr. Rose Cameron, a retired Copperas Cove ISD superintendent, as conservator.Texas has roughly\u00a01,200 school districts and charters.\u00a0A TEA takeover is a rare and\u00a0drastic way\u00a0to try to remedy a district\u2019s problems, which vary.\u00a0This year, the agency\u00a0intervened\u00a0in Edgewood ISD over accreditation issues. In\u00a02014, they\u00a0assumed\u00a0control in\u00a0Beaumont ISD following a lengthy mismanagement saga. In 2012, the TEA stepped in at\u00a0El Paso ISD after a\u00a0test cheating scandal.\u00a0Appointed boards\u00a0remain in place for up to two years before school board elections may resume.While this takeover was no surprise,\u00a0Seabolt blamed failures by the TEA for Marlin ISD\u2019s issues. He cautioned other school districts to be wary of agency monitors and officials.\u201cThe Marlin ISD board of trustees was given some very bad advice and false reports from the former TEA monitor,\u201d Seabolt alleged in an email to the Waco Tribune, referring to a monitor before Cameron.\u201cThe district worked on almost nothing meaningful, at least as far as classroom instruction goes, for years. When I got here last year, I read the reports, observed instruction myself and told the board the monitor\u2019s reports were not consistent with classroom performance or testing data,\u201d he wrote.\u201cHad the board not been deceived by someone the board considered an expert, the kids would not have lost years worth of quality instruction. Warning to other schools: Some TEA monitors are excellent, some have no clue how to improve a school. It\u2019s a roll of the dice with TEA. Be warned.\u201dTEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe\u00a0commissioner is taking the action because the district did not meet the requirements of the abatement agreement.\u201dAssistant Superintendent and High School Principal Remy Godfrey told KWTX she would like to see current leadership remain. \u201cWith the monitor who we have now becoming conservator, and working well with us, we should keep leadership in place because we have made some good strides this last year.\u201dSeabolt told the Waco newspaper\u00a0the district had \u201cgreat improvements last year with the instructional systems\u201d they put in place. This year, he said Marlin ISD attracted and retained \u201csome quality teachers\u201d because of salary increases.Parent LaTonya Heath has two children enrolled in Marlin ISD. She is thankful the schools will remain open. \u201cI don\u2019t think the TEA changes will affect our kids,\u201d she told KWTX. \u201cI\u2019m elated they didn\u2019t close down the school district.\u201dFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Marlin ISD, Superintendent Michael Seabolt, TEA takeover, Texas Education Agency, Texas Education Commissioner Mike MorathComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The lawsuit was filed in Texas in U.S. District Court Southern District of Texas, Galveston Division. The \u201cPlaintiff States\u201d are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\u00a0against the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA); the United States of America; the United States Department of Commerce; the Secretary of Commerce; and the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information.The complaint, attached below, states that \u201cThis suit involves the Federal Government Defendants\u2019 stated plan to abandon NTIA\u2019s option rights under its contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN\u201d) \u2026 cancel its cooperative agreement with Verisign, Inc. (\u201cVerisign\u201d) \u2026 referred to as the \u201cCooperative Agreement\u201d; delegate its authority to approve changes to the Internet\u2019s root zone file; and otherwise take steps to cede U.S. government trusteeship over functions that it has deemed are \u2018vital to the stability and correct functioning of the Internet,\u2019 without statutory authority to do so and in violation of the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment.\u201d These state attorneys general charge that \u201cNTIA\u2019s proposed actions are unlawful and should be temporarily restrained and enjoined.\u201dICANN has always been overseen by the U.S. Commerce Department but the federal government\u2019s contract with ICANN is set to expire on September 30th. The Obama Administration, Texas Attorney General Paxton says, \u201cannounced it plans to let ICANN become fully independent.\u00a0As a result, authoritarian regimes like Russia, China, and Iran will now have the ability to interfere with what should be a free and open internet.\u201dThe lawsuit argues that the Obama Administration plan \u201cviolates the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution by giving away government property without congressional authorization, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by chilling speech, and the Administrative Procedure Act by acting beyond statutory authority.\u201d\u201cTrusting authoritarian regimes to ensure the continued freedom of the Internet is lunacy,\u201d Attorney General Paxton said. \u201cThe president does not have the authority to simply give away America\u2019s pioneering role in ensuring that the Internet remains a place where free expression can flourish.\u201dBreitbart Texas spoke to Arizona AG Mark Brnovich who stressed: \u201cThis is a very important issue, but unfortunately people are not paying attention to it. It is important to raise these issues and concerns which unfortunately should have been addressed by Congress.\u201d He referred to the discussion of the threats as \u201ca parade of horribles\u201d that have been dismissed.The Arizona AG said that there are real concerns as it relates to the First Amendment. He noted that other countries may resent our nation\u2019s constitutional liberties and added, \u201cI am very concerned that they will no longer be guaranteed.\u201d He said other countries and \u201cauthoritarian regimes\u201d \u201cunfortunately, do not share our view.\u201d He said we can look at what has happened in sports and pointed to the International Olympic Committee. He said they were \u201cincompetent or corrupt.\u201dAs reported by Breitbart News, President Obama\u2019s push to hand-over control of Internet domains would give interests in China, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea an ability to have authoritarian control over online speech. In July, the government in China banned online news reporting, leaving only the government to post \u201cnews.\u201d Bloggers who criticize the regime can be charged with a crime, and people who live in the country know that they do not have freedom of speech on social media. Russia and China reportedly are working in partnership toward the goal of more controlled censorship of the Internet. Turkey has an outright ban on social media and it is a crime to insult the president. Public flogging and jail sentences are used to punish dissidents in Saudi Arabia and according to the article, Turkey is often seen as the world leader in blocking Twitter accounts. Saudi Arabia has about 400,000 websites blocked. North Korea\u2019s \u201cInternet\u201d is essentially only for government propaganda and surveillance.Not surprisingly, Americans overwhelmingly oppose President Obama\u2019s plan to hand control over to international interests.

In the most recent case, agents found 14 illegal immigrants who had been stuffed inside a tractor trailer filled with onions.The detention took place Tuesday night at the Falfurrias Border Patrol checkpoint approximately 80 miles north from the Texas border. The checkpoint presents the last barrier for human and drug smugglers looking for a way into northern cities. According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley Sector, on Tuesday evening, agents encountered a driver and a passenger from El Salvador who were moving a shipment of onions.The two men were legal permanent residents. A Border Patrol K-9 alerted authorities to the trailer where agents found the 14 immigrants stuffed among pallets of onions. One day prior, Border Patrol agents in Falfurrias arrested Francisco Armando Cerda, a commercial truck driver who had 26 illegal immigrants stuffed inside the cabin of his truck. Court documents obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that in addition to the illegal immigrants, agents also found close to 120 pounds of crystal methamphetamine hidden. On Sunday, agents had a similar encounter when they arrested commercial truck driver Sammy Garcia. Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that Garcia appeared nervous at the time he pulled up to the inspection station in Falfurrias. The man\u2019s nervousness and certain inconsistencies in Garcia\u2019s story prompted agents to take a close look at his truck.

Since that time, the Rocky Mountain State has become known as the \u201cNapa Valley of cannabis, the Houston Chronicle reported. Now, 30 people are facing charges of engaging in organized crime, tax evasion, money laundering and racketeering for allegedly smuggling that marijuana to Texas.The suspected leader of the organization is Ton Le, 39, the Houston paper reported. He lived in Houston prior to moving to Colorado and then on to Hawaii. Le reportedly has one prior misdemeanor charge. The alleged money-man, Tony Artis, is also from Houston. His criminal record includes several misdemeanor and felony charges and convictions. Those include felony possession of marijuana and tampering with evidence. The evidence tampering case is still on-going at this time, according to Harris County, Texas, District Clerk records obtained by Breitbart Texas. Artis was extradited from Harris County to Arapaho County, Colorado earlier this year on a misdemeanor fugitive warrant.Other Texans included Pete Pham, Michael Pham, Tuan Van Ho, De Ren Mei, David Nguyen, Michael Pham, Peter Pham, Johnathan Phuc Hong Tieu, Linh Ngoc Tran, Victor Leduke, and Jeffery Yi. Some of the individuals listed have not yet been arrested.Schiller reported Vietnamese-American crime organization have also specialized in the production of high-potency marijuana in California. Law enforcement reports these groups are more difficult to infiltrate and investigate that other criminal organizations.The investigation goes back as far as February 2015 when Colorado police discovered a house that had been converted to a grow house and was \u201cfalsely operating as a medical marijuana operation. Pete and Michael Pham were allegedly operating the house and hired the undercover officers to cultivate plants for medical patients. Officials determined the medical forms used by the Phams were invalid and part of a larger scheme.Shortly before this, a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper pulled over a vehicle driven by Tien Nguyen in Smith County. The trooper discovered over $70,000 in cash. His driver\u2019s license carried the address of the home in Colorado mentioned above. The cash as packed in vacuum-sealed bags in the hatch back and glove box. He was charged with money laundering in Smith County.The Colorado Attorney General is handling the prosecution of the cases in that state. The AG is working with federal authorities to seize bank accounts and other property in Colorado and Hawaii along with other criminal proceeds.Barbara Roach, head of the Denver DEA office said marijuana smuggling out of that state is a growing problem. \u201cThey come from all over the United States,\u201d Roach told the Chron. \u201cSome of them come here and try to sell here, but almost always it is grown here and it totally goes out of state.\u201d\u201cWe only look for the largest, the most prolific organizations we can find and work them up and on occasions work them down,\u201d Roach continued. \u201cThe problem is we keep stumbling into more and more marijuana cases \u2026 because of the criminal organizations coming here.\u201dThe Houston paper reported that the growing criminal organizations involved in smuggling marijuana out of Colorado are not likely to be part of Mexican drug cartels. Many do not even have prior criminal histories.The Houston Chronicle article contains an interactive map showing the Colorado-Texas connections in this case.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

A 22-year-old man from Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico was attempting to cross the border from Mexico in a Volkswagen sedan.Officers at the DeConcini crossing seized\u00a0a combination of cocaine, heroin and\u00a0meth from within a VW sedan. (Photo: U.S. Customs and Border Protection)Officers directed the man to a secondary inspection station where a search revealed packages containing cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Officers estimated the value of the shipment to be $346,600, the CBP stated.Later that day, another K-9 alert led the CBP officers to search a Ford SUV that was being driven by a 40-year-old Mexican national from Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. After searching the SUV, officers found packages of cocaine and meth estimated to be worth $55,000.Elsewhere on the Arizona border, CBP officers at the Mariposa crossing referred a Jeep SUV to a secondary inspection station. A search of the vehicle did not reveal any drugs. Agents searched the passengers and found they were smuggling meth under their clothing. The 19-year-old male who was driving the Jeep and his 22-year-old female passenger were carrying more than three pounds of meth under their clothing. The man and the woman were both Mexican nationals from Nogales, Mexico. The meth being smuggled was estimated to be worth nearly $10,000.Three more drug smuggling attempts were thwarted the day before, officials reported this week. On Sept 21, a K-9 officer at the DeConcini crossing alerted when a Buick sedan attempted to cross from Mexico. The Buick was being driven by a 19-year-old Mexican national from Nogales, Mexico. A search of the Buick uncovered bundles of methamphetamine.

A body cavity search of the 25-year-old woman resulted in the discovery of a pound of meth estimated to be worth about $3,000. While this was happening, officers at the DeConcini crossing inspected the vehicle of another Arizona woman. Agents searched her Ford van and discovered packages of heroin and meth. The drugs weighed nearly 50 pounds and was estimated to be worth $364,000. The 27-year-old woman from Nogales, Arizona, was arrested.All of the suspects were arrested and turned over to Homeland Security Investigations for possible prosecution.

Trevi\u00f1o is expected to go before a judge on Thursday morning. Law enforcement spokesmen with various federal agencies would not confirm nor deny the capture of Trevi\u00f1o, however sources with direct knowledge of law enforcement operations in Texas confirmed the arrest to Breitbart Texas. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting for more than 11 months, two rival factions of the Los Zetas cartel have been fighting for control of lucrative drug trafficking routes and territories. The battles between the two factions has resulted in a massive spike in violence throughout the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. While Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s reasons for traveling to Houston remain unknown, in the past, various cartel commanders have sought refuge in the U.S. when fleeing certain death at the hands of their rivals in Mexico. In October 2014, Breitbart Texas broke the news about the capture Gulf Cartel boss Juan Francisco \u201cComandante Panochitas or Commander Pussy\u201d Saenz Tamez in the border city of Edinburg, Texas. Soon after the arrest of Saenz Tamez, authorities captured two other top cartel commanders in the Lone Star State.

Lucasfilm\u2019s Immersive Entertainment division will reportedly help build the virtual reality world.The short film will be the first project for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu since coming off of two back-to-back Oscar wins for The Revenant and Birdman.The director has been an active and outspoken\u00a0advocate for illegal immigrants.At a fundraising gala in Los Angeles in November, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu decried the \u201cconstant and relentless xenophobic comments\u201d espoused during the U.S. presidential election and urged immigration advocates to call illegal immigrants \u201cundocumented dreamers.\u201d\u201cIf we continue to allow these words to water seeds of hate, and spread inferior thoughts and unwholesome emotions around the world to every human being, not only will millions of Mexicans and Latin American immigrants be in danger, but immigrants around the world now suffering, will share the same dangerous fate,\u201d the director said at the fifth annual LACMA Art and Film Gala.I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has also been a vocal critic of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and in particular, his plan to build a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, telling reporters after the Director\u2019s Guild of America Awards in February that Trump\u2019s plan would \u201cbetray the foundation\u201d of America.I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s film isn\u2019t the only upcoming project to explore the experiences of illegal immigrants from Mexico.

I think it is crucial in America that we do so, because the violence has many roots\u2013housing, health care, poverty, but certainly it has the tool, and that is guns,\u201d Jackson Lee began in her 5-minute floor speech. \u201cThat is automatic weapons like AK-47s and others more sophisticated.

The AK-47 is manufactured in both automatic and semi-automatic models. In a semi-automatic weapon you must pull the trigger each time you want to fire. An automatic weapon will fire as long as you hold the trigger, until you run out of ammunition. Rarely are fully automatic weapons used in crimes. In fact, their ownership is already highly restricted and registered nationally, the Free Beacon article states.Hoffmann wrote:Automatic weapons are not commonly used in gun crimes in America, however. Since 1986, the sale of newly manufactured automatic weapons to civilians have been banned. If an individual wants to purchase an automatic weapon, they have to go through a strict vetting process\u00a0while also registering that weapon with the federal government. As a result, automatic weapons are also very\u00a0expensive to personally own.Jackson Lee\u2019s attempt to associate automatic with gun violence across the nation would not likely pass an unbiased fact-check.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

A YELP user posted on the Pi Pizza review page, \u201cConstitutional pizza is the best. Shame the owner doesn\u2019t think so,\u201d it was reported.Another reviewer wrote \u201cIncredibly rude staff and owner, all very unprofessional.\u201d The reviewer alleged that they \u201cCalled some potential customers \u2018poor white trash who can\u2019t afford pizza\u2019 and \u2018inbreds.\u2019 When referring to veterans, he said \u201coh, you\u2019re a veteran \u2013 have a \u2018kick to the balls treat\u2019 big hero.\u2019 The reviewer from Conroe, Texas, goes on.There is a message that comes up when you visit the YELP page for the restaurant that states that they are in the mist of cleaning up the page after the restaurant has been in the news.A comment on Facebook on the Open Carry Texas page calls-out Ellis for being a \u201chypocrite,\u201d writing \u201cFrom his own mouth, he\u2019s admitted to needing a gun to stop a would-be robber. Imagine that? \u2018Liberalism\u2019 is a mental disorder. \u2026 He needed a gun to protect himself in his personal gun-free zone, and already knows his signs are worthless. He\u2019s just your typical liberal; guns for them, but none for you. I wonder if his hipster customers would still eat there if they knew he was packing a concealed pistol? You can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201dThe Pi Pizza HTX Facebook page\u00a0has a notice that they have found themselves \u201cin a social media conflict with a coalition of individuals from across the country that set out to sabotage our business by creating fake reviews and leaving false and disturbing comments on all of our social media outlets.\u201dA comment to the post said, \u201cI want to thank you for standing up for those that are not gun carriers, as myself, and would feel much safer if more establishments had \u2018no gun law!\u2019 Thank you thank you.\u201dEllis also responded to the controversy saying, \u201cYou know what guns are good for?, They\u2019re good for killing people.\u201d\u00a0He was reported to mention the wounding of nine people by lawyer Nathan DeSai as he shot people from a strip center parking lot in Houston as they drove to work early Monday morning. Breitbart Texas had a live wire report about the shootings.\u201cThe restaurant owner says lots of anti-gun advocates are starting to support the business as a response, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is patriots never forget. Those anti-gun people might be throwing you support right now, but we\u2019ll remember who you are long after they\u2019ve forgotten this ever happened,\u201d Ken Webster, Jr. radio producer and personality from Houston told Breitbart Texas.CJ Grisham, founder of Open Carry Texas, told Breitbart Texas, \u201cPi Pizza is under fire not because of any signs in their window, but because of their treatment of a customer who pointed it out. Had they simply responded like any other civilized and professional business, there would not have been such an outcry from the pro-liberty movement. Their childishness and vulgar actions set them apart from all the other businesses that post signs and respectfully explain their reasoning.\u201dTerry Holcomb, Sr. of Texas Carry said, \u201cThe behavior of Pi Pizza is simply unacceptable. Speaking that way to any customer simply because they disagree with a policy is nothing more than liberal antics. We rarely put any any businesses on a \u2018don\u2019t go list.\u2019\u00a0They have made it to the top of the list with the thousands of Texas Carry members in Houston and surrounding areas.

Clinton used Machado, a former Miss Universe winner, in an effort to paint Trump as a sexist claiming he had shamed her weight gain. Clinton said Machado, who was born in Venezuela has since become a U.S. citizen and is planning on voting in the November election. What Clinton and apparently the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service appear to have missed is that numerous news reports in Mexico point to Machado having had a lovechild with a top lieutenant of the Beltran Leyva Drug Cartel.According to various Mexican news articles, Machado had a love affair with Jose Gerardo \u201cEl Indio\u201d Alvarez, a currently jailed capo who is believed to have fathered the beauty queen\u2019s daughter. News about the love affair set off a scandal in Mexico in April 2010 when authorities captured Alvarez. At the time, multiple major news outlets in Mexico quoted court records, witness testimonies and sources within Mexico\u2019s law enforcement to assert that Machado\u2019s daughter was fathered by the fearsome capo. Additional reports revealed that during the child\u2019s baptism, the top leadership of the Beltran Leyva Cartel was in attendance\u2013including the Beltran Leyva brothers and Edgar \u201cLa Barbie\u201d Valdez Villarreal. Machado has denied the allegations that she had a daughter with El Indio and has claimed that the father is a Mexican businessman by the name of Rafael Hernandez. This year, Machado claimed that the Mexican government was going to release an official document clearing her name and legally proving that her daughter was not El Indio\u2019s.

The drug lord had been hiding out in an upscale apartment complex with a series of tunnels that allowed him to avoid detection. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, Sinaloa has seen a resurgence in violence as members of the Beltran Leyva and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion appear to be making a push into the territory. The hostilities resulted in a team of gunmen invading the rural town of Badiraguato and ransacking the home where El Chapo\u2019s mother was living.\u00a0 Not long after the robbery, at least one of El Chapo\u2019s sons was kidnapped at gunpoint from a tony restaurant in the Mexican resort town of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

They told Evans that\u00a0Salvant, who sentenced Couch to jail for 720 days as a new condition of an existing 10 year probation, has a financial interest in the case because Couch could sue him for wrongful incarceration, the Fort-Worth Star Telegram reported.Couch is five\u00a0months into an\u00a0adult jail sentence ordered by Salvant. This time represents four 180-day jail terms\u00a0for each of the four people\u00a0he killed while driving drunk in June 2013. Couch was 16-years-old at the time. In the subsequent high-profile trial,\u00a0Wynn and Brown represented\u00a0the teen with an\u00a0\u201caffluenza\u201d defense,\u00a0attributing Couch\u2019s reckless behavior to\u00a0a coddled and affluent upbringing where he did not know right from wrong.\u00a0Although prosecutors sought 20 years of prison, a lenient juvenile judge gave Couch\u00a010 years of probation, residential rehab, and counseling.Recently, the teen\u2019s legal team filed\u00a0two motions. One maintained\u00a0Couch should be released from jail because Salvant, a criminal court judge, did not have jurisdiction over the case, which originated in\u00a0juvenile court and should be handled in civil court. If\u00a0the motion is granted, all orders by Salvant, including Couch\u2019s jail term, would be thrown out. The other motion was to have Salvant removed\u00a0from the case. Salvant\u00a0deferred this decision to Evans, who will review the matter and\u00a0issue a written decision.\u201c[Salvant] had no subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d Wynn told Evans. \u201cIf that is the case, there is an argument that [Couch] has been illegally incarcerated since April 2016,\u201d according to the Star-Telegram. Wynn stated that if\u00a0Couch was illegally jailed, he could have an \u201carguable\u201d case for a lawsuit against Salvant. The counselor added\u00a0such a legal action against the judge could create a conflict of interest which would force Salvant to recuse himself.Couch\u2019s case\u00a0transferred\u00a0automatically from the juvenile to the adult court system on his 19th birthday in April. His lawyers asserted Salvant\u2019s criminal court jurisdiction was\u00a0adult felony cases.Tarrant County prosecutor Richard Alpert countered that Couch\u2019s case \u201cceased to be a civil case when it was transferred from juvenile to felony court.\u201d He called the\u00a0defense\u2019s argument about a possible lawsuit a \u201cnovel theory,\u201d according to the Star-Telegram, commenting:\u00a0\u201cTheir argument is based on a hypothetical argument that they may sue the judge. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dCouch sat in the courtroom wearing\u00a0a red jail issued jumpsuit. His hair, formerly dyed black when he fled with mother Tonya to Mexico, had grown out to its reddish-blonde color, according to the Fort Worth newspaper, which described him as having a thick beard. His father,\u00a0Fred Couch, attended the\u00a0hearing\u00a0but did not speak to reporters. Salvant placed a gag order on the case.Last\u00a0December,\u00a0authorities believed Couch violated the terms of his probation and his mother, Tonya, allegedly assisted him in fleeing the country. Although their disappearance\u00a0triggered an international manhunt, they were found\u00a0quickly\u00a0in Puerta Vallarta and were extradited to Texas.Salvant also oversees the case of\u00a0Tonya Couch. She\u00a0awaits trial on felony charges of money laundering and hindering the apprehension of a felon, her son Ethan. Weeks before the two vanished, she allegedly withdrew $30,000 from a personal bank account.On September 19, Tonya Couch\u00a0appeared in court with her attorneys Stephanie Patten and Steve Gordon who filed a motion stating she\u00a0can no longer afford their services and has no visible means of support nor receives any alimony from her ex-husband, Ethan\u2019s father. They revealed\u00a0Couch lost a job tending bar\u00a0one day after her start date because of intense media coverage of her case and employment. Her lawyers asked Salvant to reclassify them under court-appointed status so they could continue to represent her, meaning taxpayers would pick up the financial burden of her legal expenses. Salvant has not ruled on this motion yet.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Affluenza Teen, Ethan Couch, Fort Worth, Judge David Evans, Judge Wayne Salvant, Tarrant County, Tonya CouchComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Many suffer from PTSD. As reported by Breitbart News on August 26th,\u00a076-year-old Navy veteran Peter A. Kaisen, of Islip, New York, killed himself in the parking lot of the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center after reportedly being turned away for emergency care. The stress also sometimes brings poor choices which leads to incarceration.Sheriff Hickman told Breitbart Texas, \u201cVeterans are dumped into society after service and unless they find a way to hook-up with society, they can get into trouble.\u201d Many of them do not know they have PTSD or anger issues. Many veterans engage in substance abuse as an escape mechanism. He said the program has been very helpful but while they have qualitative information on the success, the Sheriff looks forward to having more quantitative data.The Sheriff of the third largest office in the United States paid a visit to the Stars and Stripes and Freedom Project cell blocks during a surprise inspection. He visited with inmates who are engaging in and benefiting from the programs. The Freedom Project is the civilian equivalent version of the Stars and Stripes program.The program gives the participants the \u201cduty and discipline that they get in the service,\u201d Hickman told Breitbart Texas. They include U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance veterans and some sailors, he said. A handful of men in the group shared their stories about what the program has meant to them. Accountability is part of the program, he said \u201cPTSD is a diagnosis not an excuse.\u201d\u00a0He told them to do the program \u201cfor yourself.\u201dThe program offers veterans who are in the county jail medical and mental health care, group therapy, VA assistance as well as employment counseling and job skills training.The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office also has a program called the \u201cFreedom Project\u201d. It offers drug and alcohol rehabilitation in the jail. The Freedom Project has a very impressive 3% recidivism rate for the men who take part in the program.\u201cMost often we see programs such as these operating in the State\u2019s prison system,\u201d explains Sheriff Ron Hickman. \u201cOur belief is that county time shouldn\u2019t be wasted. If you\u2019re incarcerated in Harris County, either pre or post trial, I want you to have access to the services that will help you best reenter the community.\u201dOnce the participants leave the programs, caseworkers and volunteers follow-up with them even after they leave. Hickman said they are given assistance and direction on making good choices for their new lives on the outside.The Sheriff said he told them he was going to put up a sign in the jail that said, \u201cYou Are Not Welcome.

The plaintiff father asks for general and special damages, and also names the Center for Security Policy and Executive Vice President Jim Hanson as defendants.\u201cDemand is hereby made of each Defendant for correction/retraction of the statements set forth below, to be published in the same manner and medium as the original publications and to include an acknowledgment that the original publications were false and erroneous,\u201d he pleads in the petition (attached below).Mohamed Mohamed complains that The Blaze aired a show on September 22, 2015 that was hosted by Glenn Beck with guest VP Jim Hanson of the Center for Security Policy and Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne. As to this broadcast the petition recites:During\u00a0the\u00a0discussion\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0arrest\u00a0of\u00a0Ahmed\u00a0Mohamed,\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Beck\u00a0\u2018proposed\u2019\u00a0the following:\u00a0\u2018My theory is\u00a0that for some\u00a0reason Irving is\u00a0important to the Islamists,\u00a0not the Muslims, but the Islamists.\u00a0It could be as simple as the progressives trying to turn Texas\u00a0blue, and this is just the place where they\u2019re just going to start planting the seeds and taking a stand. You (Mayor Van Duyne) pissed them off, and now this is a dog whistle.\u00a0This is not a\u00a0story that is for anybody to hear, except for the Islamists because once you create a boogeyman, now all the money, all the resources, all the intellectual power, all is focused on your little town of Irving, Texas.\u2019 Mr. Beck contended that the\u00a0circumstances surrounding the arrest of\u00a0Mohamed could not be \u2018explained\u2019 any other way.As to Mr.\u00a0Hanson, the petition urges:Mr. Hanson agreed with Mr. Beck\u2019s contentions, stating \u2018I think it\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that this latest event was a PR stunt. It was a staged event where someone convinced this kid to bring a device that he didn\u2019t build, as you mentioned. It\u2019s a RadioShack clock that he put in a briefcase, and in a briefcase it looks like a bomb\u2026..They did that to create the exact scenario that played out. They wanted people to react, and they wanted to portray this kid as an innocent victim. I think he was a pawn of potentially his father. His sister actually claimed that she was suspended. His sister told MSNBC that she was suspended by the same school district for making a bomb threat years ago. Don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true yet, but she said that in her own words. So, there\u2019s a vendetta from them, and they\u2019re tied, as you mentioned, with CAIR and CAIR is Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas tied. They\u2019re basically involved in civilization jihad, so I think you\u2019re right.\u2019Mohamed contends that Mayor Van Duyne \u201cparticipated in this discussion and did not object to or correct any of the comments.\u201d The Blaze he adds, \u201cfailed to act with due care in the broadcasting of this false and malicious content.\u201dThe boy\u2019s father pleads that \u201cMs. Van Duyne also stated on numerous occasions that Ahmed was not forthcoming with the school or the police and stated that Ahmed had brought a \u2018hoax bomb\u2019 to school.\u201d He also urges that she was quoted in an interview with KDFW on September 28, 2015, \u201cthat the Mohamed family was \u2018non-responsive\u2019 to the City\u2019s request to release records about the incident and that Ahmed was \u2018not forthcoming with information.\u2019\u201d He asserts that the statements \u201care false and were made negligently and/or with malice. Ahmed did not take a \u2018hoax bomb\u2019 to school. He never claimed that it was a bomb, threatened anyone or attempted to scare anyone. Ahmed answered all questions about his alarm clock and his intent. The City never made a request to the family for permission to release records.\u201dMohamed claims that the statements made by Beck, Van Duyne, and Hanson constituted libel per se. He demands a retraction and correction of the statements made during The Blaze broadcast \u201cin the same manner and medium as the original broadcast.\u201d He wants them to \u201cacknowledge[e] that the original broadcast was false and erroneous and stat[e] that the Mohamed family are peaceful Muslims who have been falsely accused of being terrorists and engaging in jihad.\u201dHe also complains that \u201c[o]n Fox 4 News on or about November 23, 2015, Ben Ferguson misrepresented that \u2018this was a pre-planned idea by his father. I think he used his son. He is one of those, you know, \u2018I\u2019m gonna point out anyone that\u2019s against Islam type of guy. I\u2019m going to cause problems.\u2019\u201dMohamed also urges that Ben Shapiro appeared on Fox News on or about October 19, 2015 and stated that it was \u201cclear\u201d that \u201cthis was a hoax, this was a setup and that President Obama fell for it because it confirms a couple of his pre-stated biases against police and against people who he perceives to be Islamaphobic.\u201d Among other statements, he cites Shapiro for saying \u201cthe story didn\u2019t hold water from the beginning.\u201d He adds, Shapiro concluded the segment:by making fun of both the President and Ahmed saying that Ahmed\u2019s meeting at the White House was a \u2018bit of a downgrade\u2019 from what he expected, which was \u2018a star studded event we expected between the President and Ahmed Mohamed where the President was going to knight him, give him the Order of Merit\u00a0and then declare him the greatest scientist since Isaac Newton.\u2019Ben Shapiro is the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Wire.The boy\u2019s father enumerates other alleged statements of Ferguson and Shapiro within the 21-page petition attached below, and points to the YouTube video titled \u201cBen Shapiro Exposes Clock-Boy Narrative.\u201d A retraction and correction is also demanded of Ferguson, Fox News, and Shapiro.In addition to general and special damages, exemplary damages and attorneys fees and expert witness fees are also requested.At the end of his pleading he asserts:The broadcasts aired by Fox and the\u00a0Blaze are the\u00a0very definition\u00a0of \u2018yellow journalism.\u2019\u00a0To broadcast inaccurate,\u00a0biased and sensationalized falsehoods in\u00a0the guise of \u2018news\u2019 is\u00a0an offense, not just to\u00a0the victims of the defamatory statements, but to the\u00a0public.\u00a0The public has been misled into believing that the Mohameds are terrorists who plotted to have the Irving police wrongfully arrest a teenage\u00a0boy for\u00a0bringing an\u00a0alarm clock\u00a0to school.\u00a0These broadcasts\u00a0irresponsibly fan the\u00a0flames of fear and anger toward\u00a0Muslims and\u00a0immigrants.\u00a0Each of these\u00a0Defendants should be\u00a0required to retract their falsehoods and broadcast the truth.As reported by Breitbart Texas, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed filed a federal lawsuit on August 8th\u00a0in Dallas against the Irving Independent School District, the MacArthur High School Principal and the City of Irving.

Calls New Orleans an Illegal Immigrant 'Magnet'", "id": "post-5126410", "content": "by John Binder27 Sep 2016New Orleans, LA0In front of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, Landry criticized the policies of New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D) and the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD), which prohibit law enforcement from asking residents about their immigration status.Landry rhetorically asked Committee members why being in the United States illegally was not a reason to deport an individual back to their native country.\u201cAll that does is lead to those people committing additional crimes and thinking it\u2019s okay to break the law,\u201d Landry said, according to Fox News.Landry, who has been fighting for a ban on sanctuary cities since he assumed office last year, told the Committee that New Orleans\u2019 policies are increasing crime and driving up taxes.\u201cLos Angeles saw all crime rise in 2015: violent crime up 19.9 percent, homicides up 10.2 percent, shooting victims up 12.6 percent, rapes up 8.6 percent, robberies up 12.3 percent, and aggravated assault up 27.5 percent,\u201d Landry told the committee, according to the Washington Examiner.Specifically, Landry spoke about the recent death of 36-year-old St. John District Fire Chief Spencer Chauvin of Gramercy, Louisiana and two other victims who were killed after an illegal immigrant drove a bus into an ongoing, minor car crash, as Breitbart Texas reported.Along with Chauvin, the illegal immigrant bus driver and Honduran national Denis Yasmir Amaya Rodriguez killed 33 year-old Vontarous Kelly and 21-year-old Jermaine Starr in the crash.Rodriguez, who was driving the bus full of illegal immigrant workers, was headed to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to find low-skilled work in the aftermath of the region\u2019s devastating flood which destroyed more than 60,000 homes.The company which reportedly hired the illegal workers, WRS, is owned by local Louisiana Constable Eddie Schmidt, as well as David Wallace, a state legislator in Arkansas, as Breitbart Texas reported at the time.Landry said the case was just one example where illegal immigrants have taken advantage of sanctuary city policies, making it even harder to deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes.The use of foreign illegal immigrant workers is not a common trend in the state.Similar the state\u2019s current flooding disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 brought out a slew of foreign nationals who were hired illegally by contractors and home-repair companies to do the work gutting and rebuilding properties.Landry pushed for statewide ban on sanctuary cities earlier this year. Despite being widely supported by residents in the state, the legislation was blocked by state Democrats who gutted the bill in order to render it ineffective.Before the committee hearing, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) echoed Landry\u2019s concerns with New Orleans\u2019 status as a sanctuary city, calling the policies \u201coutrageous\u201d on his Facebook page.\u201cBy hindering federal immigration officers\u2019 ability to apprehend criminal aliens, the Justice Department consciously disregards the safety and security of the American public by enabling the release of these criminals back into our communities to commit more crimes,\u201d Gowdy wrote.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

He was wanted in connection with a federal indictment unsealed Friday on racketeering schemes, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday.The indictment, reported by Breitbart Texas on Friday, alleges that Chimene Onyeri, 28, Marcellus Antoine Burgin, 26, and Rasul Kareem Scott, 24, were involved in a scheme to commit wire fraud and identity theft. The conspirators allegedly attempted to kill Judge Kocurek in connection with their crimes. The suspects were charged with one count of conspiracy to participate in an enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and, one count of aggravated identity theft. Onyeri is also charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud; an additional count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and, six additional counts of aggravated identity theft.When officers attempted to arrest Burgin, a resident of Cypress, Texas, on Friday, he led them on a high speed car chase in southwest Houston, as reported by Breitbart Texas. After crashing his vehicle, he took off on foot and eventually eluded police. The manhunt for the suspect led to his arrest in New Orleans Monday night.Burgin is now in custody in Louisiana and is expected to appear in federal court on Tuesday. Alleged co-conspirator Scott is also in custody in Louisiana. Both men are expected to be transferred to the Austin District of the DOJ\u2019s Western District of Texas. The alleged shooter in the attempted assassination of Judge Kocurek. Chimene Onyeri, is scheduled for a detention hearing on October 6.\u201cThis multi-agency investigation uncovered a diabolical scheme that went from multi-faceted fraud to an attempt on the life of a State judicial officer,\u201d United States Attorney Richard L.

Illegal immigrants frequently attempt to hike through the ranch lands in this county to circumvent detection at the checkpoint. Agents arrested the Salvadoran and took him to the Falfurrias Station for processing, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro in McAllen, Texas.During processing, a records check revealed the man was wanted in Dallas County, Texas, and had an active warrant from the sheriff\u2019s office on a charge of Indecency with a Child/Sexual Contact. The warrant was issued on March 17, 2015, Castro stated. The Salvadoran fugitive will be turned over to the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It is likely that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will place an immigration detainer on the alleged child molester, but Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez has previously announced her office may not honor immigration detainers on a case-by-case basis.Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced in October 2015 that sanctuary policies like those announced by Sheriff Lopez will not be tolerated in Texas. He pledged that any jurisdiction in Texas that will not honor immigration detainers will not be allowed to obtain state law enforcement funding grants.\u201cYour refusal to fully participate in a federal law enforcement program intended to keep dangerous criminals off the streets leaves the State no choice but to take whatever actions are necessary to protect our fellow Texans,\u201d Abbott said at the time in a written statement to Lopez. \u201cNow more than ever, it is essential that state, federal, and local law enforcement work collaboratively to protect our fellow Texans and to ensure that our laws are upheld, not disregarded.\u201dOther agents working in Starr County, along the Texas Border with Mexico, apprehended two additional illegal aliens who had recently crossed the border illegally. The two individuals were from Honduras and Guatemala. The illegal aliens admitted to Border Patrol agents they were members of the hyper-violent transnational criminal Mara Salvatrucha gang (MS-13).Other agents working in Kingsville, also located about 80 miles north of the Texas/Mexico border on Highway 77, apprehended a Salvadoran national and arrested him. During processing, the agents determined the Salvadoran national was also a member of the MS-13 gang.Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the violent criminal activities carried out by members of the MS-13 gang accross the U.S.Castro stated that all of the foreign nationals were referred to Homeland Security Investigations for possible prosecution.

Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan appeared before a federal judge in Houston to hear the formal charges against him. He was accused of providing material support to a terrorist group and of lying about his ties to terrorist organizations on his application to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was also accused of lying about having weapons training.Al Hardan is a Palestinian born in Iraq who entered the U.S. as a refugee in 2009.\u00a0He was granted permanent residence status on or about August 22, 2011 and lived in Houston at the time of his arrest.Prosecutors say the ISIS sympathizer indicated he wanted to target the Galleria and Sharpstown malls in Houston with bombs before he was arrested and charged with terrorism-related charges.Al Hardan reportedly trained with an AK-47 outside of Houston.Click2Houston\u00a0reports that Al Hardan is set for a rearraingnment hearing and thus is expected to change his not guilty plea. He is in jail because he was denied bond.The three-count indictment charged the Iraqi refugee with: attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State; unlawfully procuring citizenship or naturalization; and making false statements.The indictment alleges that \u201cAl Hardan attempted to provide material support and resources, including training, expert advice and assistance, and personnel\u2014specifically himself\u2014to a known foreign terrorist organization.\u201dThe charge of attempting to provide material support to terrorists carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and a maximum fine of $250,000.Al Hardan is also accused of knowingly certifying and swearing untruthfully on his formal application when applying to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. He is alleged to have represented that he was not associated with a terrorist organization when, in fact, he associated with members and sympathizers of ISIL throughout 2014. The charge of false citizenship procurement carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism.The indictment further alleges that during an interview in October 2015, Al Hardan falsely represented that he had never received any type of weapons training, when he allegedly received automatic machine gun training.

The parking facility is the first step in a plan to renovate the historic domed facility that is expected to cost $105 million in total, according to a report by the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Steve Gonzales.The Astrodome made history when it opened in 1965 as the largest domed structure in the world. It was nicknamed the \u201c8th Wonder of the World\u201d and was the home of the Houston Astros and Oilers teams. The building is owned by the taxpayers of Harris County.County officials stated they believe the parking facility is the first step to making the facility more functional as a conference center and festival location. It is also expected to draw other commercial uses such as restaurants and shops. The Astrodome contains more than 550,000 square feet of useable space surrounding the giant floor.The plan calls for $35 million of the $105 million project to come from Harris County taxpayers. Another third of the funds are expected to be generated from parking fees. The balance would be made from hotel taxes. The County\u2019s contribution is approximately the same cost to the taxpayers as estimated demolition expenses. The project saves the \u2018Dome from future decay and eventual demolition.When completed, the Astrodome will have roughly 240,000 square feet of space to be used as an indoor park or for events, KHOU CBS11 reported. The surrounding 550,000 square feet would be used as retail or hospitality space.The first phase is expected to take about a year to complete after work on the project begins.Currently the Astrodome costs the county taxpayers almost $170,000 per year to maintain. Taxpayers get little from that expenditure at this time. The renovation is expected to turn the facility into a revenue-generating property and add to the value of the County-owned NRG Stadium and Convention Center.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The Texas Association of Hispanic County Judges and County Commissioners, Texas State Conference of NAACP Branches, Mexican American Legislative Caucus of the Texas House of Representatives, League of United Latin American Citizens, The United States of America, La Union Del Pueblo Entero, Inc., Texas League of Young Voters Education Fund, and others sued claiming the law was unconstitutionally discriminatory.The two questions presented in the petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court (attached below) are:The AG argues that the court of appeals affirmed the district court finding that \u201cPlaintiffs have not demonstrated that any particular voter . . . cannot get the necessary ID or vote by absentee ballot under [Texas\u2019 voter-ID law].\u201d He also argues that there is no evidence that the law affected political participation by minority voters. This would be \u201cfatal\u201d to a \u201cvote-denial\u201d or \u201cvote-abridgement\u201d claim under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, he reasons.The U.S. Supreme Court should hear the case the State argues because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (and later the Fourth Circuit) \u201ccreated a split by holding that a voter-ID law violates \u00a72 based solely on a statistical racial disparity in preexisting ID possession, the general correlation of race and socioeconomic status, and a nine-factor analysis developed for vote-dilution claims.\u201dThe Fifth Circuit also went against multiple precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court by remanding plaintiffs\u2019 discriminatory-purpose claim to the district court after vacating the district court\u2019s finding. Even after the district court \u201ceviscerated legislative privilege and granted unprecedented discovery, legislators produced thousands of documents, including internal confidential communications, and sat for lengthy depositions. But that discovery yielded no evidence of discriminatory purpose,\u201d the State writes.An interim remedial Order has been issued which applies to the November 8, 2016, election. The Order was intended to provide a temporary solution for State officials as it relates to the specified forms of ID allowed for voting.An Obama appointee, Judge Nelva Gonzalez Ramos in Corpus Christi, Texas, issued the interim remedial Order on August 10th mandating that \u201cVoters who appear on the official list of registered voters and present a valid voter registration certificate, a certified birth certificate, a current utility bill, a bank statement, a government check, a paycheck, or any other government document that displays the voter\u2019s name and address and complete and sign a reasonable impediment declaration shall be permitted to vote using a regular ballot.\u201d In addition to spending at least $2.5 million for informing voters of changes, the Court ordered that the State \u201cshall continue to educate voters in subsequent elections concerning both voter identification requirements\u00a0and\u00a0the opportunity for voters who do not possess SB 14 ID and cannot reasonably obtain it to cast a regular ballot.\u201dIn October 2014, Judge Ramos held that the Texas voter photo ID law, SB 14, violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it had an impermissible discriminatory effect, including deliberate discrimination against blacks and Hispanics, violated the Equal Protection Clause, and unconstitutionally offended voting rights guaranteed under the Fifteenth Amendment, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas. The Obama appointee also ruled that the Texas law was an unconstitutional poll tax prohibited by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment because the law provided for a fee for issuing copies of birth certificates or other information needed for a voter ID.In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Texas\u2019 voter photo ID law had a discriminatory effect under the Voting Rights Act, but reversed the district court\u2019s finding of discriminatory purpose, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas. The 9-6 ruling also found that it did not constitute a poll tax but ruled that the lower court must put an \u201cinterim remedy\u201d in place to mitigate the \u201cdiscriminatory effects.\u201d The Fifth Circuit also warned that the district judge should \u201censure that any remedy acted ameliorates SB 14\u2019s discriminatory effect, while respecting the Legislature\u2019s stated objective to safeguard the integrity of elections by requiring more secure forms of voter identification.\u201d The appellate court also remanded the case to the district court to later determine if the voter ID provisions were written to be intentionally discriminatory.Judge Edith Jones wrote the dissent to the Fifth Circuit en banc opinion which was joined by four judges. As\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart News, Jones wrote,\u00a0\u201cRequiring a voter to verify her identity with a photo ID at the polling place is a reasonable requirement widely supported by Texans of all races and members of the public belonging to both political parties.\u201dThe President Ronald Reagan nominated judge also wrote, \u201cBy keeping this latter claim alive, the majority flans the flames of perniciously irresponsible racial name-calling.\u201d She also wrote that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cjudge-made \u2018solutions\u2019\u201d \u201cwill backfire.\u201d The public will \u201cquestion judges\u2019 impartiality,\u201d and \u201c[l]awmakers at every level will be forced to be race-conscious, not race-neutral, in protecting the sanctity of the ballot and the integrity of the political process,\u201d she explained.Jones added that \u201cthese unauthorized and extra-legislative transfers of power to the judiciary disable the working of the democratic process, which for all its imperfections, best represents \u2018we the people.\u2019\u201dIn a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the petition for writ of certiorari, Paxton said, \u201cSafeguarding the integrity of our elections is essential to preserving our democracy. Voter ID laws both prevent fraud and increase the public\u2019s confidence in our elections. Texas enacted a common-sense voter ID law and I am confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately reinstate it.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

In April, the feds\u00a0charged\u00a0Ganceres with the sexual exploitation of a child, also known as the production child pornography.In June, she\u00a0pleaded guilty to the crime which took place in 2015. At the time, Ganceres\u00a0told the court she and boyfriend, Daniel Benson Billman, Jr., who is a registered\u00a0sex offender, placed an ad on Craigslist in which the two presented\u00a0themselves as offering babysitting services. Investigators indicated\u00a0the victim\u2019s mother answered the ad with the understanding that she hired a babysitter to care for her two-year-old daughter but, instead, Billman molested the toddler\u00a0and Ganceres recorded the sexual assault.On Monday, the court factored into Ganceres\u2019 sentencing a letter read by the victim\u2019s mother, in which this parent described the traumatic impact the sexual abuse had on the two-year-old, the U.S. Department of Justice stated\u00a0in a press release.U.S. District Judge\u00a0Nelva Gonzales Ramos gave Ganceres 30 years in prison. Upon her release, Ganceres will face 10 years of supervised release. Additionally, the\u00a0court will impose a number of special conditions intended to protect children from\u00a0Ganceres. Although what those measures may be were not disclosed by the Justice Department, they will restrict\u00a0Ganceres\u2019 access to minors and prohibit her use of the Internet. She will also have to register as a sex offender.\u00a0For now, Ganceres will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future, according to the\u00a0U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern District of Texas.Back in January,\u00a0Billman, 43, pleaded guilty to the same charges. Then, on\u00a0March 16, Senior U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack sentenced him to 50 years in federal prison.KRIS reported authorities obtained a search warrant in August of 2015 and raided Billman\u2019s home where they\u00a0seized a cellular phone. On it, investigators discovered the video with\u00a0the sexually-explicit abuse Billman perpetrated against the two-year-old girl which\u00a0Ganceres recorded. Agents also found\u00a0thousands of child pornography images during the search of Billman\u2019s residence. He\u00a0had 14 prior criminal convictions. Five of them were for failing to register as a sex offender.During Billman\u2019s sentencing, the court also heard\u00a0testimony from a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent who explained that authorities discovered other text messages between Billman and a different\u00a0woman, the mother of an 11-year-old daughter,\u00a0according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.\u00a0In\u00a0those communications,\u00a0Billman requested nude photographs of the child, instructed the woman on how to take the photographs, and told\u00a0her how to groom the child in order to entice her into having sex with him.The case against Ganceres was part of\u00a0Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the U.S. Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices and the Criminal Division\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, child abuse, Child Pornography, child sex abuse, Daniel Benson Billman, Project Safe Childhood, Rosa Linda GanceresComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The body of their victim was left behind in a GMC Sierra. The recent murder took place in broad daylight in one of the main avenues in this city. The gunmen riding in a Honda Accord were able to murder Armando Amador Garcia, a commander with the Nuevo Leon Attorney General\u2019s Office, and subsequently elude forces from Monterrey Police, Fuerza civil and military forces. A second man riding in the vehicle with the 42-year-old commander was able to avoid the hail of bullets and went to hide inside a local business until other police forces responded. Unofficial sources claimed that the passenger was a prosecutor, that information was not officially confirmed nor denied by authorities. Detectives combed through the surveillance video that shows the moment a gunmen leans out of the Honda Accord, grabbing a rifle and firing into Amador\u2019s vehicle. According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Nuevo Leon law enforcement sources, Amador is a native of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. He had been in law enforcement for more than a decade working at the state and federal levels. In recent years, Amador was fired from the Nuevo Leon Ministerial Police in the suburb of San Pedro.Relatives of the commander told Breitbart Texas that Amador was not fired but he resigned after the murder of a top ranking police officer. That officer was a close associate of then Nuevo Leon Attorney General Adrian De La Garza who is currently the Mayor of Monterrey. In 2015, Amador joined the Nuevo Leon AG\u2019s office once again where he was assigned to lead a group of officers carrying out operations securing the Northern highways in the state which have seen a spike in cartel activity. Authorities have not publicly determined a motive for the execution. It remains unclear if the murder was tied to the anti-cartel operation or if it was revenge for his previous investigations against drug dealers in Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\u00a0Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

Days before the kidnapping of Lopez, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, a group of gunmen kidnapped and murdered two other priests. The gunmen stormed a parish in the city of Poza Rica where they kidnapped 50-year-old Alejo Nabor Jimenez Juarez and 30-year-old Jose Alfredo Juarez de la Cruz.\u00a0In that case, a third man who was identified as an assistant to the priest\u00a0 was also kidnapped but managed to escape. The employee alerted authorities and gave a general location of where he escaped\u2013triggering a search that later turned up the bodies of the two priests.The cartel gunmen responsible for the murders used the priests\u2019 garments to tie one of them up, leaving their bodies behind in a field. One of the priests was choked to death while the other one was beaten and stabbed. In response to the murder of the three priests in less than a week, the Catholic Church in Mexico issued a prepared statement condemning the murders, asking for a thorough investigation and avoid any character assassination until all the evidence was available.\u201cWe demand with all respect and urgency from the competent authorities the clearing up of the truth in both cases and the application of justice for those responsible of these inexcusable crimes,\u201d the statement from the Catholic Church revealed. \u201cWith the same force we demand that the name of any priest or person not be stained especially when the investigations have not concluded,\u201dIldefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

All of the immigrants were identified by Border Patrol agents as being from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.Illegal immigrants are frequently held in stash houses by their smugglers as they attempt to extort additional funds from family members. They are often beaten and threatened whereas women are sometimes sexually assaulted as a means of intimidation.On September 14, Breitbart Texas reported that a Mexican national who had been living in Houston was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in a U.S. prison for human trafficking.

Demetrick Pennie was like a slave that Harriet Tubman could not free because he could not comprehend his own bondage. The post elicited a number of supporters to Judge Martin\u2019s sentiment, typically calling Pennie a \u201ccoon\u201d and other derisive messages. A sitting Texas State Representative apparently joined the racialist banter as well.Martin\u2019s thoughts led others to compare Pennie to a \u201ccoon\u201d, \u201cJudas\u201d and Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s house slave character \u201cStephen\u201d in the 2012 film, Django Unchained. The derisive comments were repeatedly cheered by Martin\u2019s lines of \u201claughing-so-hard-I\u2019m-crying\u201d emojis and others.Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D \u2013 Dallas, Mesquite) also appears to join in with a \u201cStephen\u201d reference via his Facebook account.Judge Martin currently serves in the 304th Juvenile District Court. She originally graduated from Texas Wesleyan University School of Law in 2000 and later worked for the Dallas County District Attorney as a general prosecutor and subsequently represented Child Protective Services.Sergeant Demetrick Pennie told Breitbart Texas that Martin and Johnson\u2019s comments as elected officials are the exact sentiments that only drive communities further apart.\u201cThese statements are the very instruments used to perpetuate the divisiveness that we continue to see in society,\u201d Pennie said. He also argued that elected officeholders be held accountable for their racially-derogatory language.The inflammatory statements on Facebook follows a pattern of online abuse and threats leveled against Sergeant Pennie since he joined a lawsuit against the leadership of Black Lives Matter and its prominent backers. Days prior, Pennie complained to the Dallas Police Department and the FBI that someone likely within the DPD leaked his confidential employment information so that the general public could confront him while on duty or at home. He explained that he began receiving direct messages from non-DPD contacts, often containing death threats. Several social media posts purport to show individuals taking credit for sending notes or encouraging others to do the same.\u00a0Breitbart Texas previously reported on Pennie\u2019s effort to hold proponents of Black Lives Matter accountable in a federal lawsuit:The head of a Dallas police organization is suing a collection of Black Lives Matter figureheads and other prominent individuals for allegedly inciting racial violence against American police officers.Dallas Police Department Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, filed an amended federal complaint September 16 against more than a dozen defendant institutions and individuals to build a class action case on behalf of \u201cpolice officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians\u201d for \u201cinciting\u201d race riots and related violence.The suit hopes to produce damages and an injunction placed against alleged threats of racially-motivated violence going forward.Sergeant Pennie recently petitioned the federal court to expedite his case due to the incoming threats received.Logan Churchwell is the Assistant Editor and a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

He and the terrorists who traveled to Garland attended the same mosque in Phoenix. \u00a0Prosecutors charged that Kareem provided the firearms to the two Islamic terrorists and that he trained and housed them. He took them to the desert to practice shooting targets.United States District Court Judge Susan R. Bolton is presiding over the case.The indictment alleged that \u201cthe three men became interested in violent jihad and the foreign terrorist organization the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\u201d It also stated, \u201cThe three men watched and read ISIL-related videos and other materials relating to ISIL and violent jihad and expressed their support for the terrorist organization.\u201d \u201cOn or about 2014\u201d the three \u201cbegan conspiring to support ISIL.\u201dKareem was indicted in December 2015\u00a0on five counts: (1) Conspiracy; (2) Interstate Transportation of Firearms with Intent to Commit a Felony; (3) Making False Statements; (4) Felon in Possession of Firearm; and (5) Conspiracy to Provide Material Support to a Foreign Terrorist Organization.Prosecutor Joseph Koehler accused Kareem\u00a0telling the jury,\u00a0\u201cHe was a motivator. He was a bankroller. He was a trainer and an intended participant.\u201d The two men had a photo of an ISIS flag that they brought to Texas.\u201cThey want to announce to the world that we are here on behalf of ISIS,\u201d the prosecutor told the jury. Referring to Kareem, he said, \u201cHe knew exactly what was going on with these folks.\u201dKareem has also been accused of having accessed an Islamic State database of U.S. military servicemen and women\u2019s home addresses, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by the New York Daily News, and of planning an attack at\u00a0Super Bowl XLIX in Arizona. As reported by The\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0a former roommate testified that Kareem asked him where he could get explosives to blow up the stadium. The\u00a0Times\u00a0also reported that the prosecution introduced testimony from experts on terrorism that detailed the recruitment methods used by terrorists, including the Islamic State.The two Islamic terrorists who traveled to Texas, Kareem\u2019s co-conspirators, were shot and killed within 15\u00a0 seconds after they reached the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas, as\u00a0reported by Breitbart Texas. The terrorists arrived at the gun-free zone armed with Kel-Tec Sub-2000s and grenades. The Curtis Culwell Center is part of the Garland Independent School District.Breitbart Texas reported that the officer who fought off the two Islamic terrorists received the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor from President Obama in May. The terrorists\u00a0were firing Kel-Tec Sub-2000s and wearing body armor. The officer who killed them, Garland Police Officer Gregory Stevens, was armed only with a pistol, a .45 caliber Glock.In July 2015, Pamela Geller, the art exhibit\u2019s\u00a0organizer, wrote\u00a0an article\u00a0revealing information about the terrorists\u2019 mosque in Phoenix, as well as other mosques that have been attended by terrorists.\u00a0Geller said\u00a0Ibrahim (formerly Elton) Simpson and Nadir Soofi, the two terrorists who attempted the attack in Garland,\u00a0were members,of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix.Geller wrote that Simpson\u2019s friend Courtney Lonergan remembers, according to the\u00a0Arizona Republic, that \u201cSimpson would never waver from the teachings he picked up in the mosque and elsewhere.\u201d Lonergan said, \u201cHe was one of those guys who would sleep at the mosque. The fact that he felt personally insulted by somebody drawing a picture had to come from the ideological rhetoric coming out of the mosque.\u201dAfter the terror attempt in Garland, ISIS claimed credit for the attack, as\u00a0reported by Breitbart Texas. They called the terrorists \u201csoldiers of the caliphate\u201d and promised more violence.\u00a0The message was transmitted\u00a0in an audio statement through\u00a0the group\u2019s Al Bayan radio station, according to an AP report published on the ABC13 News\u00a0website. It was not clear if the shooters were acting under direct orders from the Islamic State, or if they pledged their allegiance to ISIS and then acted on their own.\u00a0One day after the attack, Breitbart News\u00a0reported that approximately 200 Muslims in Pakistan held a gathering to honor the Garland jihadis.The attack has been referred to as a \u201cjihad against free speech,\u201d as\u00a0reported by Breitbart News.Breitbart Jerusalem and the AFP reported today that the judiciary in\u00a0Jordan put a media blackout on the murder of a Christian writer killed outside an Amman court where he faced charges over an anti-Islam cartoon.

The majority from this map occurred in Phoenix, a major destination point for people who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The map also shows that encounters occurred at ports-of-entry, likely from persons either walking up and asking for asylum or from Sinaloa cartel attempts to smuggle them into the U.S. in vehicles. Most significantly, the map shows that many of the encounters occurred near the border outside of ports-of-entry, indicating that persons were attempting to sneak into the U.S.Page Six shows a pie chart indicating that the majority of encounters in Arizona were with Islamic known or suspected terrorists, both Sunni and Shi\u2019a.

A 30-day period for public comment is required. Chief Press Officer of the THHSC, Carrie Williams, told Breitbart Texas that after reviewing the feedback and comments received during this period, the State republished the rules with more information and another 30-day comment period. A copy of the proposed rule with the changes highlighted, is provided below.The potential\u00a0costs are\u00a0expected to be offset by costs currently being spent by facilities on disposition for transportation, storage, incineration, steam disinfection and/or landfill disposal\u00a0according to sources at THHSC. It is important to note that the\u00a0current rules, attached below, apply only to tissue generated by the healthcare facility. If a woman miscarries at home there is no requirement to carry the fetal tissue or blood products of a miscarriage to a doctor\u2019s office or hospital.The\u00a0Texas Tribune\u00a0reported in early August that lawyers for pro-abortion groups have threatened \u201ccostly litigation.\u201dIn October 2015, after the revelation of the gruesome videos filmed at various Planned Parenthood facilities in the country, including Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston, Texas, the THHSC issued an order banning the abortion provider from participating in Medicaid programs, as reported by Breitbart Texas\u2019 Bob Price.In conjunction with the THHSC letter, Governor Abbott announced his LIFE Initiative program designed to provide even greater protections for children in the womb, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The initiative also aims at preventing the sale of baby body parts.Part of Abbott\u2019s initiative calls for new legislation to be enacted by the next session of the Texas legislature.Abbott\u2019s LIFE Initiative calls for the following:Laws must be changed to (1) make it a felony under Texas law to perform a partial-birth abortion; and (2) make it illegal for abortion doctors to risk a woman\u2019s health by altering the procedure to preserve fetal body parts.Improve and expand the availability of adoption services; and increase awareness about Texas\u2019 already best-in-the-nation child-support enforcement program, so that young mothers considering how to deal with pregnancy know the father will be held accountable to support his family.Funding for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers out of taxpayer money must be eliminated completely, both at the State and local levels.Eliminate and criminalize any sale or transaction of fetal tissue by an abortion clinic for any purpose whatsoever.While Democrats have been strongly opposed and pro-abortion groups threaten legal action against the new rules,\u00a0the moves by Governor Abbott and the THHSC have been widely praised by Republican elected officials and right-to-life organizations.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

On September 22, a white female officer in Tulsa was charged with first-degree manslaughter after she shot and killed Terence Crutcher. As reported by Breitbart News and the AP, Officer Betty Shelby was charged after dashcam and aerial footage showed the shooting and Crutcher walking away from the officer with his arms in the air. The footage does not include a clear view of when the officer fired the sole shot that killed the 40-year-old black man.At one point, a confrontation developed between the protesters and police, according to the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Keri Blakinger. The standoff occurred in a parking lot on the University of Houston campus. Ultimately, the protesters backed up and took a different path.\u201cF**k blue lives,\u201d shouted one protester that Blakinger described as \u201cparticularly incensed.\u201d She reported others chanting \u201cPig, pig, bang, bang.\u201dThe protesters occasionally blocked street intersections remained peaceful and out of the flow of traffic\u00a0during the protest.The usual chants of \u201cNo justice, no peace!

The protest march was dubbed a \u201cDay of Remembrance\u201d in honor of those killed in officer-involved shootings.Event organizer Gregory Chatman told Lee, \u201cWe just want black people to feel safe in our communities. We want to go outside without worrying about if police are going to kill us today or harass us today.\u201dProtesters invaded the intersection of Scott and Wheeler Streets for a few moments.

Sanchez carried the hopes for the growing Latino electorate in California, but has struggled to catch up with Harris\u2019s growing lead in the polls, and there are signs that Latino voters are increasingly backing Harris.Both candidates in the general election are Democrats, thanks to California\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d or \u201cjungle\u201d primary, in which the top two vote-winners in the primary advance, regardless of party.Sanchez had challenged Harris to four debates, but Harris only agreed to two.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The study shows that most millennials are living in quiet desperation. They face a job market that has left even normally employable new college graduates out of work, or employed at well below their potential as baristas, temps, or in low-level retail jobs.Millennials understand that this situation will have a substantial impact on their lifetime earnings, due to depressed early years and and due to finding themselves\u00a0on a lower income track than those few that landed higher-quality roles straight out of college.According to EIG cofounder and executive director Steve Glickman:The Millennial mindset was dramatically impacted by the harsh economic realities of the Great Recession, which has made them remarkably politically independent, economically pessimistic, and skeptical of traditional institutions. What the establishment doesn\u2019t understand is that in their minds, Millennials did all of the right things \u2013 they worked hard, got their education \u2014 but they incurred huge amounts of debt and the job market they inherited hasn\u2019t rewarded any of these sacrifices. Now they are deeply concerned about their future.Key takeaways about Millennials from the survey:Millennials deeply admire entrepreneurship and believe it is the key to economic success, despite the fact that 90 percent of all new businesses fail within three years. Millennials also believe their biggest impediment to starting their own business is capital:Millennials have a very low level of confidence in American institutions. They are \u201cskeptical of the establishment,\u201d while \u201cremaining fiercely patriotic and supportive of a leading role for the United States in the world\u201d:Millennials are generally comfortable with their own tax burden, but they remain concerned about fairness in the tax system.Millennials tend to prioritize federal spending on education and entitlements:Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics, Economic Innovation Group, entrepeneurial, entrepreneur, Ernst & Young, financial crisis, Great Recession, Millennials, patrioticComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

She made little effort to appeal to the voters, and seemed content to cast aspersions on her opponent. Sanchez, on the other hand, came across as overly eager to appease\u00a0viewers, speaking directly to the camera in a highly animated manner, and\u00a0becoming overly defensive about her record in office.For conservatives watching the race, there was little to enjoy.\u00a0The moderators did a reasonable job of asking pertinent questions about the economy, foreign policy, and issues like immigration. But the candidates stayed firmly within the left-wing paradigm. Neither had anything of interest to say about water issues, for example, with Harris focusing on conservation measures and Sanchez boasting about\u00a0the new innovation that\u00a0is taking place in her\u00a0Southern California stomping ground.The only point of relative interest was when Harris attacked Sanchez for stating\u00a0that up to 20 percent of Muslims support terror. Sanchez, who serves on the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee had been citing global polling data, but Harris and others had cast her remarks as anti-Muslim.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The New York Times reported that Martin, III of Glen Burnie, MD, was arrested, like Edward Snowden, while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA. Martin was supposedly discovered in an investigation of theft and disclosure of a large cache of top-secret NSA spying tools.During a search of Mr. Martin\u2019s residence, agents found paper documents and digital drives that were labeled \u201ctop secret,\u201d including six classified documents that were written in 2014, according to an affidavit filed in conjunction with his arrest.The FBI affidavit said: \u201cDuring the interview, Martin at first denied, and later when confronted with specific documents, admitted he took documents and digital files from his work assignment to his residence and vehicle that he knew were classified.\u201dBut Martin has now been alleged to have also stolen \u201cSensitive Compartmented Information\u201d (SCI), which Breitbart sources referred to as NSA\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels.\u201d These are offensive algorithms used in cyberattacks on foreign military and government systems.Unlike Snowden, who exposed files to demonstrate that the NSA was illegally spying on every American citizen, Martin allegedly operated under the dark net moniker of \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d to hack the NSA Equation Group\u2019s cyber-mining tools. He then offered to sell the wildly valuable cyber-secrets for 1 million bitcoins, or about $560 million.During the months of August and September, the Obama administration was claiming that the devastating hack of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) by Guccifer 2.0 was a in reality a covert operation by the Russian FSB\u2019s Institute of Cryptography and Protection of Information (IKSI) that is tasked with cyber-warfare.President Obama used a press conference on August 4 regarding the DNC break-in to state, \u201cIf in fact Russia engaged in this activity, it\u2019s just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about and that I\u2019ve got a real problem with.\u201dThe arrest of an NSA insider after two months of the President claiming the Russians were responsible for national security hacking raises concerns that his administration may have been using a \u201cfalse flag\u201d to cover-up their its own incompetence in protecting cyber-secrets from disgruntled or greedy employees.Following Snowden\u2019s 2013 intelligence breaches, the Administration\u2019s investigation and after-action corrective action plan should have entailed tremendous enhanced surveillance, countermeasures and staff vetting at Booz Allen to make sure that U.S. cyber-security operations are impenetrable from the outside and from the inside.Although Martin is suspected of taking the highly classified NSA \u201csource code\u201d developed to break into foreign computer networks, the Times reported late Wednesday that two intelligence sources tried to downplay the theft by claiming some of the information the contractor is suspected of stealing was \u201cdated.\u201dSnowden chimed in on Twitter from somewhere in Russia: \u201cThis is huge.

This measure would require that when state policymakers want to issue revenue bonds for a project that exceeds $2 billion, they must first\u00a0have\u00a0that approved by a vote of the people. This is a brilliant idea because, frankly, there is no adult supervision in the State Capitol. Special interests own the place, and since they make big bucks from state spending, it stands to reason they love to see any new revenues. This measure ensures a reasonable case for this epic amount of borrowing must be made to We, the People. I wrote about this measure in detail here.Prop. 54 \u2013 The California Legislature Transparency Act. The primary component of this measure sounds simple, but actually represents substantial reform. It would require that any proposed legislation in the State Capitol be made available to the public in its final form for 72 hours before it can be voted upon in each chamber. Yes, this continues the theme of applying adult supervision. I cannot tell you the number of terrible, horrible pieces of legislation that are jammed through at the end of session. Tax increases, new regulations, new programs \u2013 most that would raise a hue and cry of concern, except by the time the public finds out \u2013 it\u2019s too late. Read more about it here.Prop. 65 \u2013 Jam The Greedy Grocers. A couple of years ago, after trying about a hundred times, the enviro-extremists in the legislature passed a law banning single-use plastic grocery bags, and imposing a ten cent tax on each paper bag. The tax was set up in a way that the grocery stores pocket the ten cents. Before you scratch your head, let me explain further. For years the California Grocers Association was part of the coalition stopping the bag ban. But on this last go-around, they switched sides, as estimates pegged the grocers\u2019 revenues from the bag taxes at hundreds of millions of dollars. Enough voters signed petitions to halt the bag ban, and it has been placed on the ballot as Prop. 67 \u2014 on which I am voting \u201chell no.\u201d But in case it passes, I\u2019m \u201chell yes\u201d on 65, which would take the revenue from the greedy grocers and instead repurpose it to state environmental programs \u2013 and leave the sell-out grocers holding the bag, so to speak. I wrote about this here.Prop. 66 \u2013 Fix the Death Penalty, Don\u2019t End It. This would address legal and administrative hurdles that have resulted in only 13 death-row inmates being executed since 1978, in order to make the death penalty work. There is another measure on the ballot, Prop. 62, that would prohibit the use of the death penalty in California. If your value system is such that you think that no matter how despicable or evil someone is, and no matter how heinous an act of violence they commit, that being put to death by the state for your crimes is a bad idea \u2013 you\u2019d want to vote \u201cyes\u201d on 62, and \u201cno\u201d on 66. On the other hand, if you think that the death penalty serves as both an important deterrent to some who would commit the most horrible of crimes \u2013 often cold blooded, pre-meditated murder \u2013 and also provides for justice for surviving victims, then \u201cyes\u201d on 66 is an important vote to cast. Read more here.As you peruse the other thirteen ballot measures maybe you will find one or two you think are a good idea. Maybe you want more state bonds issued for school construction. Or maybe you want to be able, finally, to make those pot brownies that you\u2019ve been craving since your days at UC Berkeley. I will let you sort through those decisions. But I think you will find that higher taxes and more regulations are right there on the ballot, awaiting your blessing and vote. As if California doesn\u2019t have high enough taxes, or more than enough regulations.Breitbart California, bag tax, ballot initiatives, ballot measures, Death penalty, Jon Fleischman, Sacramento, transparencyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Obama administration sought to appease international outrage over its eavesdropping on foreign leaders, revealed in Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks about the National Security Agency, by transferring control of ICANN. Critics charge that there is no\u00a0international body currently capable of overseeing ICANN, and that without the antitrust exemptions it had formerly enjoyed under U.S. law, it will eventually come under the control of the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunications Union, where repressive governments have considerable influence.Republican presidential nominee\u00a0issued a statement strongly opposing the handover of ICANN last month.Clinton led Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the overall poll, 44% to 43% in a four-way race, a result well within the poll\u2019s margin of error, and despite a majority saying that Clinton won the first presidential debate.\u00a0Libertarian Gary Johnson was third, at 4%, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein scored 1% of the vote.Joel B.

Street5 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook expects the United States economy to continue barely growing at a dismal 1.6 percent annual rate through 2016, increase to only 2.2 percent growth in 2017, and then begin to trend downward in later years. But global economic growth, at 3.1 percent, is expected to be twice as strong as the U.S. rate in 2016, improve to 3.4 percent in 2017, and then continue to outperform.IMF economists point to the U.S. elections and the Brexit vote as related phenomena that reflect \u201cpolitical discord and inward-looking politics\u201d as the main threat to further worsening in the global economic outlook.The IMF highlights the fact that international trade growth has dramatically slowed since\u00a02012, and has been running at a negative -3 to -5 percent since 2015. The IMF blames this global change\u00a0for\u00a0a substantial slowdown of investment that \u201chas been the primary restraint on trade growth, accounting for up to three-fourths of the slowdown.\u201d The IMF sees\u00a0this trend causing weak \u201cproductivity and growth.\u201dThe IMF notes\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s economic arguments, stating: \u201cConcerns about the impact of foreign competition on jobs and wages in a context of weak growth have enhanced the appeal of protectionist policy approaches, with potential ramifications for global trade flows and integration more broadly.\u201dThat is economist-speak for angry people that used to make a very good manufacturing wage in places like the U.S. Rust Belt and the British Midlands, and who may be gaining the political upper hand in rebelling against globalized outsourcing of their jobs to the Third World.The IMF suggests that advanced nations could subdue this rebellion with even greater welfare and entitlement spending policies that support \u201ctrade adjustment assistance programs and effective support for retraining, skill building, and occupational and geographic mobility could play an important role in certain cases.\u201dAfter four decades of pushing globalization as a great way to improve the lives of billions of people in developing nations, the IMF seems to be listening, at least,\u00a0to voices articulating the negative plight of millions of American workers.Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics, Donald Trump, globalization, IMF, International Monetary Fund, Outsourcing, stagnant growth, World OutlookComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak5 Oct 20160The federal lawsuit, filed by David Simon and Bryan Pease on behalf of a group called\u00a0\u201cUnited Poultry Concerns,\u201d targets Chabad of Irvine and another rabbi \u2014 even though previous suits have failed, in California and elsewhere, to show cruelty.The Chabad.org website describes the ceremony as follows:The rite consists of taking a chicken in one\u2019s hand and reciting a prayer. A man takes a rooster; a woman takes a hen; a pregnant woman takes two fowls \u2013 a hen and a rooster \u2026The fowl [or other animal] used for kapparot is taken in the right hand and the appropriate text from the prayer book is recited. The bird is then passed over one\u2019s head three times and the appropriate text is recited.The word kapparot [like kippur] means \u201catonement,\u201d and is used to refer to the chickens themselves, but one should not think that kapparot themselves serve as a source of atonement. Rather, they serve as a means to bring a person to the awareness that he might very well be deserving of death because of his sins and he will thereby be motivated to repent and ask G\u2011d for mercy.The fowl is then slaughtered in accordance with halachic [Jewish legal] procedure.It is customary to redeem the kapparot for money, which is then given to the poor; some give the fowls themselves to the poor. Others perform the entire rite only with money, reciting the prescribed verses and giving the money to charity.Kosher slaughter\u00a0prevents any suffering to an animal. In the case of chickens,\u00a0the birds are not beheaded, as in conventional slaughter, but are killed with a single incision to the neck.According to the\u00a0Orange County Register, the lawsuit states:\u201cThis sickening spectacle is scheduled to be repeated again beginning on the weekend of Oct. 8, 2016,\u201d Pease wrote in a Sept. 26 filing with the U.S. District Courthouse in Santa Ana. \u201cHowever, killing chickens is not required for Kapparot to take place, but is simply a preference. Many other entities have stopped killing chickens and instead perform the ceremony by swinging small bags of coins overhead.\u201dYom Kippur, the annual Jewish day of atonement, begins in the evening of Tuesday, Oct. 11 and ends after nightfall on Wednesday, Oct. 12. During the day, Jews abstain from food, drink, sex, bathing and wearing leather. Most of the day is spent in prayer, asking for forgiveness for sin, not just individually but for the Jewish community and the world in general.The kapparot ritual is not required by Jewish law but is a beloved custom among some religious Jews.Joel B.

Street5 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The monster Category-4 Atlantic hurricane, packing winds of 140 miles per hour, is on a path to strike Southern Florida on Friday morning, then drive up the center of the state. The storm appears to have more than enough power to veer right to hammer Georgia and the Carolinas, then move north, bringing torrential rain and flooding to the East Coast.Jason Rasgon, associate professor of entomology and disease epidemiology at Penn State University, warned AccuWeather that Zika mosquitoes are so light and unaffected by raindrops, they will be picked up and blown to a new area as the Matthew advances.There is no vaccine or treatment for the Zika virus, making prevention essential. Early on in the American Zika outbreak, public health officials falsely believed that Zika virus transmissions would remain limited to individuals that became infected through travel outside the continental U.S. to places where Zika is common, like Brazil and Puerto Rico.But with two new locally-infected Zika cases being reported in Miami Beach and another four more in Miami-Dade County, the potential Zika pandemic now has confirmed 139 cases caused by domestic transmission. The CDC reports that there are confirmed 718 travel-related Zika infections recorded in Florida, with 103 involving pregnant women.Zika is\u00a0symptomatic for only 18 percent of cases. If symptoms appear, they are usually associated with a mild flu fever, joint pain, muscle pain, headache and red eyes. Consequently, the Zika infection rate is drastically underreported.\u201cVector borne diseases\u201d\u00a0such as dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika infect over one billion people and kill over one million people per year. Zika is easily spread by 1) mosquito blood bite; 2) mother-to-child; 3) sex; 4) saliva; 5) urine; 6) blood transfusion; and 7) research laboratory exposure,\u00a0according to the CDC.For the first time in its 70 year history, the CDC warned Americans on August 1 not to travel to an American neighborhood for fear of catching an infectious disease. The CDC advised\u00a0pregnant women and their partners not to travel to a Zika-infested community near Miami that had 14 cases in a neighborhood with 200 homes and businesses.According to the World Health Organization\u2019s \u201cZika Virus Microcephaly\u201d Situation Report, dated September 29, there are now confirmed Zika cases in over 70 countries. Indigenous domestic strains are now native to South America, North America and Asia.The United States Center for Disease Control and Florida Homeland Security officials have gone all-out since August 4 with aerial and ground spraying in the Miami-Dade County \u201cDanger Zone\u201d to kill the common Aedes aegypti mosquitos that carry Zika virus.CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters\u00a0that Miami-Dade\u2019s aerial spraying of the insecticide Naled \u2014 in a fine mist fired from planes about 100 feet off the ground \u2014 was found to kill more than 90 percent of mosquitos in the 10-mile square area in Miami\u2019s Wynwood area, where the first U.S. locally-transmitted Zika cases were found.Hurricane Matthew will force an aerial pesticide spraying halt in South Florida on October 4, because it is ineffective in heavy winds. The storm\u2019s up to 25 inches of rain are expected to cause widespread flooding that will drastically increase mosquito breeding.Florida Gov. Rick Scott has desperately warned residents and business owners to drain standing water from their properties before and after the hurricane to limit mosquito population growth.\u00a0Big Government, Breitbart California, Science, Danger Zone, Hurricane Matthew, Miami, Miami-Dade County, microcephaly, pandemic, vector borne, WHO, World Health Organization, ZikaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street4 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Tesla has bet the farm on their \u201cAutopilot System\u201d as a disruptive innovation that allows its all-electric Model S and Model X SUV to independently travel, steer and brake along public streets and freeways.Although Tesla operators were noticed that they are supposed to be ready to grab the wheel and step on the break whenever an emergency presents itself, there are plenty of videos with Tesla drivers jumping in the back seat to play video games or take a nap.As a consequence, there have been about a dozen Tesla Autopilot crashes. The worst incident was a fatal May 7 crash where a Tesla driver appears to have been watching a Harry Potter video while \u201cAutopilot\u201d drove his car into a T-bone with a commercial big rig.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)\u00a0Office of Defects\u00a0probe\u2019s initial report stated that the Tesla Model S on autopilot\u00a0was speeding and never braked when the car approached a tractor trailer making a legal left turn.Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk claims the coming updated Autopilot System will make vehicles more reliant on radar versus cameras, a move Musk called a \u201cdramatic improvement\u2019 that could have prevented the recent accidents.But most Wall Street analysts believe that those changes are the result of Tesla\u2019s key supplier of semi-autonomous car technology, Israeli-based Mobileye\u00a0NV, canceling their joint-agreement to provide the computer chips and algorithms that drive \u201cAutopilot.\u201d Mobileye had warned Tesla not to promote the technology as capable of \u201cself-driving.Despite dumping Tesla, Mobileye still has agreements to supply camera-based driver-assistance systems to over a dozen other auto makers including General Motors,\u00a0Nissan Motor\u00a0Co., BMW,\u00a0AG, and Hyundai Motor that account for more than 60 percent of Mobileye\u2019s sales.The California DMV rates Tesla\u2019s Autopilot as just a \u201clevel-two version\u201d of self-driving technology, based on\u00a0a five step scale adopted by the federal government and the auto industry.\u00a0The DMV draft regulations will only allow vehicles rated at levels three, four or five to advertise they have any self-driving capable while functioning on \u201cauto-pilot.\u201d\u201cLevel-three\u201d vehicles will be allowed to only drive themselves under limited conditions without a human occupant paying attention and ready to intervene. To be a level five vehicle, the car must be able to operate on a fully automated basis under the mot sever conditions.Tesla\u2019s spokeswoman e-mailed the San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cTesla is reviewing the draft regulations and will provide input to the DMV as appropriate.\u201d She added \u201cAutopilot makes driving safer and less stressful, and we have always been clear that it does not make a car autonomous any more than its namesake makes an aircraft autonomous.\u201dTesla is pushing innovation, but Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0in October 2015 that Consumer Reports pulled Tesla Model S\u2019s perfect 100-point score as \u201cbest car ever,\u201d after receiving 1,400 responses from owners over the following month that complained about squeaks, rattles, and multiple electric motor replacements. Consumer Reports\u00a0revised its score for a new $127,820 Model S to a \u201cworse than average\u201d 43, after a study\u00a0warned\u00a0that 2/3 Tesla\u2019 cars will need entire drivetrain replacements before they reach 60,000 miles.Consumer Reports in July of this year argued that\u00a0Tesla should stop using the \u201cAutopilot\u201d name because, \u201cIt\u2019s really a driver-assist technology. CR called the advertising it as \u201cAutopilot \u2014 that was outrageous.\u201d Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit group that has been critical of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot deployment, cheered the draft regulations, \u201cThe advertising regs are exactly what\u2019s required.\u201dCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown\u00a0signed a bill into law on September 30 that does allow autonomous vehicles to operate on public roads without a driver, steering wheel or human-operated breaks. Companies can now test wat is expected to be driverless shuttles if they meet a 15-point federal safety assessment guidelines and have a two-way communication link between the vehicle\u2019s passengers and a \u201cremote operator.\u201dBreitbart California, Tech, Auto-pilot, automated, autopilot, BMW, California, dmv, driver-assisted, GM, governor jerry brown, Mobileye, self-driving, TeslaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

A second later I turned my head and just smashed into the barrier,\u201d said the Veteran.Fox News reports:Alcala said that when an off-duty police officer went to talk to Fakhraldin, he said that he caused the collision in the name of Allah. He also cited Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s treatment of minorities for why he caused the crash.Fakhraldin told an officer at the scene that he estimated his own speed to be 200 mph and that he caused the crash using psychic/telekinetic powers to control the steering. The officer said Fakhraldin showed no remorse, Fox 26 reported, citing the police report.Jihadi groups such as al Qaeda and its rival the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) have urged supporters to target military personnel. Various \u201ckill lists\u201d containing personal information about U.S. service members, government employees, and civilians have been published online by jihadists.It remains unclear how the Fakhraldin chose Alcala as a target or if he was affiliated with any specific Islamic extremist group. In July, a jihadist in France plowed a 19-ton truck down Nice\u2019s Promenade des Anglais and into a crowd assembled for a July 14 fireworks display, killing 86 and wounding more than 200. His victims include children.The carnage ended when police killed the armed truck driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, after he drove onto a sidewalk for more than a mile. Bouhlel is believed to have been inspired by ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack.Both al-Qaeda and ISIS have urged jihadists to carry out vehicular assaults against Western countries in the absence of more conventional weapons.Breitbart California, Jihad, National Security, Allah, California, veteransComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Phillip A. Talbert. Flames destroyed six homes and triggered mandatory evacuations of several communities in both counties\u2026Ranchers spotted Garcia-Avalos carrying his 4-year-old son on his shoulders west of the Cedar Creek Campground area, where the fire had been reported, according to a U.S. District Court complaint. They suspected he started the fire and offered to help, but he said he was OK. Still, ranchers recorded the conversation with an iPhone.Garcia-Avalos told the ranchers that his car had been stolen and that his son saw the man who took it, and that he was walking home to Delano, which is more than 42 miles away from the Cedar Creek area, according to an affidavit written by U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Brian Adams.The ranchers were able to convince Garcia-Avalos to enter their home so that he could call someone for help. During the visit, they asked him several questions about the fire, and Garcia-Avalos denied responsibility, prosecutors say.At the crash site, fire investigators found a burned vehicle and shoe prints belonging to a small child and an adult. The shoe prints led investigators from the car to Highway 155.Garcia-Avalos was sentenced to seven months in prison for lying to U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officers and six months for starting the Cedar Fire. After serving his 13-month sentence, he will be deported back to Mexico, when he\u2019ll start paying back $61 million in damages\u2014at the low cost of only $25 per month, or $300 each year. (At that\u00a0rate, it would take\u00a0Garcia-Avalos some 203,333 years to pay the total cost of the damages.)Sequoia National Forest, founded as a national park in 1890, holds the \u201cgreatest concentration of giant sequoia groves in the world,\u201d according to the U.S. Forest Service. The giant sequoia is the single species in its genus and grows naturally in only one area of the world, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. These magnificent trees are the oldest and largest living things on Earth.Conservative author Ann Coulter documents the sickening destruction of national parks and forests at the hands of illegal aliens setting up drug farms or attacking law enforcement as they break into the country. \u201cDespite the evidence adduced by the GAO showing that illegal immigrants are both the single largest cause of wildfires and also the biggest impediment to extinguishing them, the government report dared not suggest building a fence,\u201d she writes. \u201cInstead, our government decided that 100 percent of the price of illegal aliens\u2019 fire setting should be paid by Americans.\u201dIllegal aliens have little\u00a0respect for the American tradition of preserving natural wonders and biodiversity, Coulter writes in Adios, America:The environmental damage done to federal parkland by the Mexican pot growers is breathtaking. According to USA Today, the illegals \u201cscar the landscape by crudely terracing hillsides that erode under winter rain. They spill pesticides, fertilizer and diesel fuel used to power generators that run extensive drip-irrigation systems. They dam creeks for water sources, plant salsa gardens, disfigure trees and leave behind tons of garbage, human waste and litter.\u201d Park officers find deer carcasses hanging from trees, owls impaled on posts, and claws from grisly bears displayed as trophies. Except for one fully brainwashed government official, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to single out one group,\u201d there was no mistaking who was dumping pesticides, chopping down trees, and threatening hikers in our parks\u2026The Mexican assault on America\u2019s national parks goes well beyond what is absolutely necessary to cultivate marijuana crops. Reporters who have visited the sites gape in horror at the trash illegal aliens have left behind. Amid the plethora of two (2) New York Times stories on the pot farms, one said that law enforcement officers have found \u201celaborate tree-houses, makeshift showers and, invariably, trash and pesticides, much of which ends up in streams and creeks.\u201d The Fresno Bee reported that the illegal immigrants leave behind \u201ctons of trash\u201d in addition to poaching deer and other park animals. The Los Angeles Times said of one camp: \u201cTrash was strewn everywhere\u2014 empty cans, torn packets of noodles, a crusty leather rifle scabbard. A soggy sleeping bag was stuffed behind a tree.\u201d The chief law enforcement officer at Sequoia National Park\u00a0swept his hand toward the piles of trash, saying, \u201cNice, eh? Welcome to your national park.\u201dGarcia-Avalos also holds a criminal record including burglary and car theft charges.

Its official name is l\u2019Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s.Kardashian is a social media icon that regularly \u201cscapes\u201d her days and nights to over 50 million social media followers worldwide. She began Sunday morning by attending the Balenciaga designer show on Sunday morning, where she shocked the audience by sitting in the front row without make up.Kardashian later joked on Twitter as she left the show that her huge bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, \u201cconsistently photobombs\u201d her should-be solo paparazzi pics. Kardashian complained that he \u201cis always in my shot!\u201d It is believed that Duvier stayed constantly close to Kardashian from early Sunday morning until late that evening.Kardashian went back to the \u201cNo Address Hotel\u201d in the early afternoon, where she changed into a\u00a0lacy and silk lingerie-inspired look. She was then driven to the Givenchy SS17 fashion show, where she sat in the front row to watch her younger sister Kendall Jenner\u00a0strut the runway in honor of Jenner\u2019s September \u201ccover shot\u201d for Vogue Magazine.Transported back to the \u201cHotel,\u201d Kardashian seems to have then made another trend-setting outfit change for the late afternoon social media updates on Snaphat.Kardashian then changed into her final outfit of the day, in what was described as a risqu\u00e9 all-matte python ensemble. She was driven from the \u201cHotel\u201d in the early evening with Duvier to attend an exclusive dinner hosted by fashion designer Azzedine Alaia at his Paris home.In what appears to be Kardashian\u2019s last social media post before the robbery, she shared a video of herself \u201cFaceTiming\u201d with her future sister-in-law\u00a0Blac Chyna, who was in Los Angeles, California hosting a celebration at her baby shower.CNN\u00a0is reporting:\u201cThe French Interior Ministry said five men threatened the mansion concierge with a weapon, handcuffed him and forced him to open the private apartment. Two of the men were able to gain entry to Kardashian West\u2019s room, according to the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office, and a gun was held to her head\u2026.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Back in July, when Clinton and Donald Trump\u00a0announced their respective running mates, it seemed that\u00a0the vice presidential debate might actually overshadow the presidential bouts, given that Pence and Kaine have more impressive resum\u00e9s in public life than either of the people that selected them.\u00a0Both men have been governors; Pence built a solid reputation as a leader on Capitol Hill, while Kaine was one of the Democrats\u2019 more respected voices on foreign policy on the Sunday talk show circuit.But since then, Pence\u00a0has rocked the campaign trail, while Kaine has been\u00a0a wet rag. While Pence has played\u00a0to packed houses across the country, Kaine has struggled to draw anyone at all, even in swing states where the contest is closest.Thus far, Kaine\u2019s only noteworthy contributions to his side\u2019s efforts have been his repeated, shrill accusations that Donald Trump is associated with the Ku Klux Klan, and his lies defending Clinton on her mis-handling of classified information.Overall, Pence has been a net positive for the Trump campaign, reassuring the public that Trump will a) appoint competent people to high posts, and b) be replaced by a capable leader, should the worst happen.By contrast, Kaine has been a net negative for the Clinton campaign. He seems to have been chosen for the sole reason that he would not overshadow her on stage. In fact, when they appear together, she seems more likely to lose. It is difficult to imagine Kaine running the country.The pattern is unlikely to change on Tuesday. Kaine will be sent onstage with a set of attack lines against Trump to reinforce Clinton\u2019s talking points from the last debate. Pence\u2019s job will be to look presidential, a task Kaine will make easier for him.The conventional wisdom is that vice presidential debates do not matter much. But they do affect a campaign\u2019s momentum.In 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin stunned a skeptical media, which expected her to fail, by outperforming then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE). The result was renewed zeal on the campaign trail for a ticket that appeared to be flagging since the first debate and the disastrous decision of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to suspend his campaign during the financial crisis.In 2012, Biden put Barack\u00a0Obama\u2019s re-election effort back on track after the president was beaten badly by Gov. Mitt Romney in the first debate. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who had prepared well for a genteel\u00a0battle of wits and policies, was stunned by Biden\u2019s antics and outbursts, which seemed clownish but successfully conveyed contempt for Ryan to a national audience.Pence will not only\u00a0give the Trump campaign a boost, but also force the media to consider, once again,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s health issues, which remain shrouded in mystery, as well as her judgment, which Trump has repeatedly called into question.That, in turn, will set Trump up for the remaining two debates \u2014 and, perhaps, for one last, and decisive, surge in the polls.Joel B.

He and former Riverside detective Scott Impola, are still awaiting trial. He then used a GPS tracker to electronically follow the Mayor home from a local bar, and then called 911.Costa Mesa Police Officers responded, detained Righeimer, and administered a field sobriety test. The city cops seemed surprised when the Mayor passed a field sobriety test. At a news conference shortly thereafter, Mayor Righeimer provided a restaurant receipt listing that he had only been drinking Diet Coke.Lanzillo is alleged to have been aided and abetted by a second private investigator named Scott Impolo, a former Riverside detective that is still awaiting trial. The goal of the effort funded by the Costa Mesa Police Association, has been alleged to dig up dirt on the then mayor and Councilman Stephen Mensinger, who is currently the Mayor of Costa Mesa.Both private detectives had pleaded not guilty. But at a pre-trial hearing in Santa Ana courthouse, Lanzillo reversed his plea and admitted to four felony counts tied to the false DUI report against City Councilman Jim Righeimer and for using another GPS tracking device to tail current Costa Mesa Mayor Stephen Mensinger.Righeimer made a statement following Lanzillo\u2019s guilty plea:\u201cThis case revolves around the Costa Mesa Police Association hiring private investigators to get information to extort elected officials for the benefit of their member\u2019s salary and pensions. This is pure political corruption. Mr. Lanzillo and Mr. Impola worked at a law firm that represented over 130 Police Officer Associations. They worked full-time getting dirt on elected officials that could be used later to extort these same elected officials when their contract came up for negotiation.\u201dThe union representing Costa Mesa police has acknowledged hiring Lanzillo and Impolo\u2019s employer, the now-shuttered law firm Lackie, Dammeier, McGill & Ethir, to investigate Mensinger, Righeimer, Costa Mesa Councilman Gary Monahan, and candidate Colin McCarthy for \u201ccandidate research.\u201dThe Costa Mesa Police Association has vehemently denied for four years knowing about any illegal actions on the part of the law firm they hired or its investigators during a period that the City Council was considering outsourcing city services.Senior Deputy District Attorney Robert Mestman confirmed to the Orange County Register that Lanzillo was not offered a plea deal, instead admitting to all the charges he was facing. He added, \u201cI think it speaks to the strength of our case,\u201d Mestman said.Mayor Mensinger to the Register, \u201cI think the message is clear, that unions and their candidate operatives who are involved in extortion and dirty tricks will see justice served cold,\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m elated with the plea and my family can put this chapter of the ongoing union nightmare to rest.\u201dMr. Lanzillo is scheduled to face up to a four years and four months prison sentence at a hearing on January 13, 2017.Breitbart California, Social Justice, Christopher Joseph Lanzillo, Cosst Mesa, Costa Mesa Police Association, DUI, police union, Scott ImpolaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The complications seemed to be FND partying.The video apology caused lots of outrage, until FND Films acknowledged that the \u201creal\u201d movie plot for \u201cIt\u2019s All Good\u201d is a comedy about their own wacky venture as millennial losers that teamed to raise $77k on Indiegogo, but blew most of the cash on cocaine, limousines, champagne, and hookers. They claim they finally had to actually make the film\u00a0because some of their unsavory donors got rough and forced them to finish the flick.FND President Fronk told Esquire the prank was planned from the start and it was\u00a0very stressful to keep the plot secret for two and a half years. \u201cWe felt this was a unique move, something that had the potential to get big, so we ran with it,\u201d Fronk added:\u201cThe whole thing has been a tricky process\u2014we were constantly worried about blowing it. We needed a catalyst for why the money was gone, but you have to ride the line where it\u2019s a believable scenario\u2013Lying to people for two and a half years is rough\u2014we\u2019ve had to take a hit in our careers because we wanted to make it look like we disappeared. We couldn\u2019t tell certain actors in the film what the movie was about, and you\u2019ve got these people who donated thousands of dollars based on the most vague pitch that you can\u2019t clue them in. I\u2019ve so badly wanted to say, \u2018No no no, it\u2019s just a joke.\u2019\u201dAs the first crowdfunding, the real Indiegogo reports that they have more than 2.5 million people from 226 countries and territories that made over $800 million in cash commitments for 175,479 deals they call \u201ccreative, entrepreneurial and cause-related projects.\u201dAlthough many crowdfunded deals have gone on to actually make products and services, Indiegogo reports only a couple have gone on to attract venture capital. Like all business start-ups, a huge number of Indiegogo deals end up having low to no return for their donors.The \u201cIt\u2019s All Good\u201d trailer announcing an October 21 release is truly hilarious. It also seems that it will be easy for FND Films to leverage the story line into a great cable comedy series about how dumb and crooked crowdfunders squander their donors\u2019 cash in \u201ccreative, entrepreneurial and cause-related\u201d partying.Big Hollywood, Breitbart California, Tech, crowd funding, donors, Indiegogo, It's All Good, venture capitalComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak3 Oct 20160It was the latest betrayal in Sanders\u2019 continuing capitulation to the Clinton machine, which began with the first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas last October, and became impossible to ignore at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.The first days of the convention were marked by spirited protests by Sanders supporters from the floor of the Wells Fargo Arena. Supporters were particularly outraged at Clinton, given the revelations by Wikileaks that the Democratic National Committee had colluded with the Clinton campaign to deny Sanders a fair chance at winning the nomination.But even as party officials literally turned out the lights on Sanders delegates to drown them out, Sanders did nothing in their defense.Instead, Sanders did Clinton the honor of personally handing her\u00a0Vermont\u2019s delegates, even as hundreds of his delegates walked out of the hall in protest. Still, Sanders supporters were not ready to blame him for what had happened. At private meetings between the delegates and their candidate, there were hugs and tears, but few questions about why Sanders could have allowed millions of voters to believe in his promised \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d when he had no intention of leading one.Though he is technically \u201cindependent,\u201d Sanders has proved he is a Party man. There is apparently no amount of corruption by Hillary Clinton\u00a0that would arouse his condemnation, and no insult to his supporters that would provoke him to rise to their defense.

Street2 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Hurricane Matthew reached Category 5 status in the early hours of Saturday morning, becoming the first to do so since Hurricane Felix in 2007. At its peak that day, Matthew\u2019s 160 miles-per-hour winds were as powerful as Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which is rated as \u201cthe most destructive storm in the U.S. modern history.\u201d However, the storm weakened in the last 24 hours to a still-ferocious Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 150-mph winds.As the most ferocious Atlantic hurricane in almost a decade, the double-eyed Matthew is set to hit land at the Southern tip of impoverished Haiti on Tuesday morning.With Hurricane Matthew moving at a 6 mile-per-hour clip, the U.S. National Weather Service expects the storm to dump an average of between 15 to 25 inches of rain on Haiti, with as much as 40 inches in some areas.\u201cThis rainfall will produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Sunday, \u201cPreparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\u201dCivil protection officials throughout the Caribbean are broadcasting warnings of a coming storm surge, stating that southern low-lying areas will be \u201chighly threatened\u201d from the approaching storm system and urging people to prepare emergency survival kits.According to the US National Hurricane Center\u2019s (NHC) latest projection, Matthew is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through at least Monday night. After hitting Haiti and Jamaica on Tuesday morning, Matthew is expected to reach Cuba by late evening.The current track indicates Matthew will smash directly into the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, or Gitmo. The Naval command is evacuating hundreds of personnel, family members and non-essential staff from Gitmo\u00a0to a Florida base, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.\u201cThe remaining military and civilian personnel will shelter in place and be able to support recovery efforts once safe to do so following the storm\u2019s passage,\u201d the Navy said in a press release.The exact path of the monster storm is indeterminate at this time, and Matthew\u2019s destructive power could increase substantially if it veers out to warm ocean waters, where it would pick up huge strength before veering back to clobber the East Coast.At a minimum, Hurricane Matthew will begin moving up the U.S. southern East Coast with winds of at least 110 miles-per-hour on Thursday morning. The U.S. National Weather Service predicts dangerous swells, coastal flooding, and beach erosion as far north as Virginia, but warns that the Mid-Atlantic and New England states could be affected within two weeks.\u00a0Big Government, Breitbart California, Environment, Cat 4, Cat 5, Category 4, Category 5, Cuba, Flooding, Guantanamo bay, Hurricane Felix, Hurricane Gilbert, Hurricane Matthew, landslides, U.S. Naval BaseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street1 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Located on the 800-mile-long San Andreas, the Southern tip of the Salton Sea suffered 142 quakes that ranged in strength from a magnitude of 1.4 to 4.3 on the Richter Scale since September 26, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Cal Tech scientists estimate that due to the concentration of the tremblors, Southern California has a risk of between 0.03 and 1 percent that the area will suffer a 7.0 magnitude quake in the near future. That may not sound like such a high probability, but it was a 7.8 magnitude quake that destroyed the Bay Area in 1906.The turn-of-the-century Great San Francisco Earthquake and resulting fires caused an estimated 3,000 deaths and $524 million in property loss. Buildings and structures were damaged in all parts of the City and County of San Francisco. In the downtown business district, which was built on ground made by filling in the cove of Yerba Buena, pavements were buckled, arched, and fissured; brick and frame houses were extensively or destroyed; sewers and water mains were broken; and gas pipelines caught on fire and caused a conflagration.Ground movements between three feet up and down, plus 15 feet sideways, were common in the City. The catastrophic quake caused similar damage for almost 100 miles, from lightly populated Mendocino County to Santa Clara County.Kelly Huston, the deputy director of crisis communications for the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, said the heavy intensity and strategic location of the swarm at the end of the San Andreas Fault caused the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services to issue the extreme warning, which will last through October 4.The southernmost tip of the San Andreas Fault has been building up pressure since Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake of 1700 that was the largest known to have occurred in the \u201clower 48\u201d United States. It rocked from California to Southern British Columbia. It also set off a tsunami that not only struck the Pacific coast, but also crossed the Pacific Ocean to Japan, where it damaged coastal villages. Written records of the damage in Japan pinpoint the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700.Morgan Page, a geophysicist with the U.S.G.S. Earthquake Science Center, told the Daily News that there is a common misconception about earthquakes that smaller ones relieve pressure on a fault and reduce the chances of a major earthquake happening. He warned that, \u201cLittle quakes can actually trigger more powerful ones\u201d and \u201cthere is significant stress stored on the southern end\u201d of the San Andreas Fault.Breitbart News reported in 2014 that after two decades of mild and intermittent earthquake activity, California suffered four very serious high magnitude quakes in 2014 that included the 6.8 magnitude Cape Mendocino quake on March 9; the South Napa magnitude 6.0 on August 23; the 5.1 magnitude La Habra quake on March 28; and the 4.4 magnitude Westwood quake on March 17.The South Napa quake that hit at 3:20 a.m. was especially concerning because it featured an \u201cEarthquake Storm\u201d with 60 smaller aftershocks\u00a0ranging in size from 0.6 to 3.6 on the\u00a0Richter scale.Geophysicist\u00a0John Dvorak, author of the book \u201cIs California Overdue for a Big Earthquake?\u201d,\u00a0warned in a Christian Science Monitor interview that a series of increasingly higher intensity earthquakes could now be building over an extended period in California. He cautioned, \u201cA lengthy vacation from earthquakes certainly sounds nice,\u201d but a quake break can just be the calm before the earthquake storm.Breitbart California, Economics, Environment, california governor, Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake, earthquake storm, Great San Francisco Earthquake, Is California Overdue for a Big Earthquake?, Jerry Brown, Office of Emergency Services, South Napa Quake, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S.G.S.

Street1 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0According to Gail Tverberg, who prophetically warned on January 6, 2008, in The Failure of Networked Systems\u00a0that banks and insurance companies were about to cause a worldwide financial crisis, just warned that \u201cLeaders around the world have demanded that their countries switch to renewable energy, without ever taking a very close look at what the costs and benefits were likely to be.\u201dWith Gov. Brown signing Senate Bill 32 (SB 32), California committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2017 to 40 percent below by 2030.California\u2019s 2015 Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) is now 2/3 wind and solar, and about 1/3 biomass geothermal and small hydro. The bulk of future RPS greenhouse reductions are expected to come almost exclusively from wind and solar.Tverberg says this commitment to solar and wind has been justified by simple calculations of \u201cLife Cycle Assessment\u201d and \u201cEnergy Returned on Energy Invested.\u201d But she argues, \u201cThese calculations miss the fact that the intermittent energy being returned is of very much lower quality than is needed to operate the electric grid.\u201dThere are four parts to managing an electrical grid: 1) create a network by building connections between power sources; 2) when a particular part of the network approaches excess demand (goes red), recognize this is happening and use the grid connections to switch demand to another network power source; 3) continue doing this until all areas are red; 4) and then begin rationing demand through black-outs.With California at 12.3 percent intermittent wind and solar electrical penetration in 2015, Tverberg points out that the state is suffering the same type of electric grid degradation that Hawaii is currently suffering with 12.2 percent solar and wind penetration.Hawaii is an island chain that cannot import energy to their electrical grid. With $331 million invested in Hawaii during 2015, its installed solar capacity hit 615 megawatts, supposedly \u201cenough solar energy installed in the state to\u00a0power 159,000 homes.But due to the intermittent challenge of needing an equal amount of standby electrical generation for periods of overcast or darkness, Hawaii has been forced to stop residential solar net metering\u00a0(giving homeowners credit for the retail cost of electricity, when electricity is sold to the grid) and\u00a0is phasing out these solar subsidies.Tverberg highlights that the intermittent \u201csituation is\u00a0not too different in California.\u201d Due to solar and wind subsidies that have driven electrical costs to 45 percent higher than the national average, over 1/3 of California\u2019s electric grid power for non-intermittent (also called \u201cdispatchable\u201d) electrical back-up must now be imported from other states, up from only 25 percent in 2010.California\u2019s solar and wind electricity generation falls quickly in the summer as the sun is setting. This period of declining availability is almost exactly the same period that the demand for \u201cdispatchable\u201d electricity to power air conditioning spikes \u2014\u00a0between 5 and 9 p.m.California claims to be reducing the \u201cstate\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d but about 80 percent of California\u2019s rapidly rising electrical imports come from fossil-fuel power plants, \u201csix percent from coal-fired plants\u201d, and up to 14 percent from nuclear.With Gov. Brown\u2019s RPS demanding rapid increases in solar and wind power generation, California\u2019s electric grid is on a crash course to exceed its ability to import enough \u201cexcess\u201d dispatchable power from other states.Tverberg believes that, due to the requirement for non-intermittent \u201coperating reserves\u201d to allow the electric grid to maintain stability, there is an \u201capparent \u201clid\u201d on intermittent electricity at 10 percent to 15 percent of total electricity consumption.\u201dBreitbart California, Environment, Tech, biomass, black outs, dispatchable, Energy Returned on Energy Invested, Gail Tverberg, geothermal and small hydro, Greenhouse Gas, Life Cycle Assessment, peak renewables, Renewables Portfolio Standard, RPS, SB 32, Senate Bill 32, solar, windComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Jerry Brown Signs Bill Criminalizing Journalists Who Distribute Recordings of Abortion Providers", "id": "post-5156571", "content": "by Dr. Susan Berry1 Oct 20160Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1671 into law, making it illegal for journalists to distribute audio or video recordings of healthcare providers without their consent.As the Los Angeles Times reports, Planned Parenthood pushed the bill through the legislature even though it is already illegal to make these types of recordings without authorization in California. The abortion business argued that further punishment was needed for distributing the materials.Spearheaded by Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), the new law comes as Planned Parenthood is desperately attempting to suppress information regarding its \u201cbaby parts\u201d scandal. Last year, undercover journalists from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released a series of videos exposing Planned Parenthood\u2019s alleged practices of exchanging the tissues\u00a0of babies it aborts for monetary consideration and altering the position of babies during abortion to maximize the chance of harvesting intact organs.Opponents of the bill have expressed concern about its potential to violate the First Amendment rights of the press and to obstruct journalists\u2019 job of providing information that is in the best interests of the public. In the case of Planned Parenthood \u2013 which receives more than\u00a0half-a-billion dollars in taxpayer funds \u2013 it is in the interest of taxpayers to know if their money is spent on potentially criminal behavior, such as the sale of body parts of aborted babies for profit.\u201cThe Center for Medical Progress never recorded \u2018confidential\u2019 communications, so California\u2019s existing recording law and the new distribution provision are simply inapplicable to our work,\u201d says CMP project lead David Daleiden about the new law. He added:However, it is clear that Planned Parenthood does not want to be held accountable to the public whose taxpayer money it gladly takes by the hundreds of millions, and will even attack freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in order to maintain its own arbitrary levels of secrecy.While Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in the baby organ scandal, its president, Cecile Richards, also released a statement last October, announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The narrative put forward at that point was that the videos produced by CMP were \u201cdeceptively edited.\u201dNevertheless, a Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion, hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos, said that while its\u00a0staff observed the videos had been edited \u2013 as most videos are \u2013 \u201cthe analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.\u201dAdditionally, Fusion noted, \u201cAnalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.\u201dAn analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were \u201cnot manipulated\u201d and that they are \u201cauthentic.\u201dAbortion, Big Government, Breitbart California, California, Center for Medical Progress, Gov.

Police had arrived on the scene after being called by Olango\u2019s sister, who said that he had been acting strangely. A widely-circulated image of the confrontation, which looks like an armed standoff, suggests that one police officer was black and the other was white.\u00a0One officer reportedly fired a Taser but the other fired live ammunition.On Thursday evening, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports, \u201cabout 50 to 75 people \u2014 a smaller crowd than previous nights \u2014 took over the intersection of Broadway and Mollison Avenue\u201d and \u201cstopped passing vehicles and broke several of their windows\u201d at about 8 p.m., according to police.

Street30 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0Deutsche Bank AG, as the 11th largest bank in the world with about $1.9 trillion in assets, is almost 4 times larger than its next-largest German rival, Commerzbank, with only about $560 billion in assets. But Deutsche Bank is also one of the world leaders in risk bearing, with $52 trillion in derivative positions. That amounts to 3.9 times the $13.2 trillion GDP for all of the European Union, and 13.3 times the $3.9 trillion GDP of Germany.Following a report from Bloomberg News that 10 of the approximately 200 largest hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche Bank AG \u2014 including Izzy Englander\u2019s $34 billion Millennium Partners, Chris Rokos\u2019s $4 billion Rokos Capital Management, and $14 billion Capula Investment Management \u2014 \u00a0U.S. stock markets began to plunge over concerns that Deutsche could potentially be subject to a bank run.Despite the hedge funds bailing out and Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s New York-listed shares falling 6.7 percent to a record low of $11.40 on September 30, a Deutsche Bank spokesman told Bloomberg that the bank is confident that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its trading clients \u201chave a full understanding of our stable financial position, the current macroeconomic environment, the litigation process in the U.S. and the progress we are making with our strategy.\u201dThe amount of cash sought by the U.S. Justice Department is not far from the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank\u2019s entire stock market value of $15.7 billion. As a sign of just how much risk the markets think\u00a0may be in holding in the German lender\u2019s unsecured debt, the cost of buying credit-default swap protection jumped to 536 basis points, the highest level since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.After the Lehman Brothers panic kicked off the last financial crisis, U.S. banks were forced to deleverage their balance sheets by about 50 percent. But European banks never took tangible action toward reducing their leveraged business and refused to recapitalize.The pressure on Deutsche Bank is beginning to spill over into German politics, stirring speculation that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government might be forced to offer support. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan told the Bild newspaper this week that government aid was \u201cout of the question.\u201d But any taxpayer-funded solution for the bank\u2019s troubles would lead to Merkel\u2019s\u00a0downfall, according to the leader of Germany\u2019s biggest opposition party.The International Monetary Fund in June\u00a0said\u00a0Deutsche Bank may be the biggest contributor to risk among so-called global systemically important banks. Most analysts still think Deutsche Bank is solvent. But many are wondering:\u00a0if there\u2019s a slim chance it might not be risky, why leave money in there?That type of lack of confidence in a banks can quickly turn into a Lehman Brothers-type panic run on deposits. Due to the cross-holdings of shared risk between big banks, if one bank gets in trouble, then a contagion can spread quickly to other banks and other nations around the world.This morning, Bank of China raised a red flag on the country\u2019s growing property bubble,\u00a0according to the South China Morning Post. \u201cA property bubble is the biggest risk for China\u2019s economy\u201d as \u201cresidential prices in major Chinese cities, from Shanghai to Shenzhen are rising at an annual pace of 30 or 40 percent in 2016, sucking the majority of bank credit into the property market and pushing prices beyond what is affordable for most residents there,\u201d said economist Zhou Jingtong, with the state-owned Bank of China.Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics, Bank of China, bank run, Capula Investment Management, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chris Rokos, crss-holdings, derivative, Deutsche Bank, financial crisis, hedge fund, insolvent, International Monetary Fund, Izzy Englander, Lehman Brothers, Millennium Partners, recapitalization, Rokos Capital ManagementComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Derenthal had originally posted about the incident online, where her story was picked up by Reddit.Derenthal had legally parked her car on Franklin Street near Lombard on July 11 before she left on a five-day business trip. According to ABC 7, she had a city parking permit, which meant she could park on the street for longer than the two-hour limit, and the\u00a0street curb she had parked on did not have red on it when she parked there.However, when she arrived back home, she walked up to her car and noticed a red zone violation ticket and saw that the spot she had parked her car on had been painted red.ABC 7 pointed out that the fresh red paint could be seen on leaves in the gutter and on the pavement. The painting crew had painted around her tire, leaving a grey space untouched by the red paint.Derenthal reportedly protested by going to the SFMTA\u2019s website\u00a0to appeal the citation, to no avail.ABC 7 noted that when it spoke with SFMTA spokesman Paul Rose, he confirmed the space was painted red after Derenthal\u2019s car was parked, and said \u201caccording to the California vehicle code, you can\u2019t park in the same location for more than 72 hours.\u201dHowever, ABC 7 notes that Derenthal\u2019s ticket was issued for a \u201cred zone\u201d violation.

Street29 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0The authoritative BGR.com blog reported that an Apple iPhone 7 smartphone exploded and completely disintegrated, but the user was unhurt.It is unclear at this time if the chemical mixture of the new higher storage cells in the iPhone 7 battery is suffering from the same inefficient combination of chemicals as the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phablet that has been subject to a worldwide recall.Apple Inc. stock (NASDAQ: AAPL) traded\u00a0down about 1.4 percent in early morning trading, and dragged the NASDAQ Index down about 0.5 percent.No information has been made available by any Apple Inc. corporate spokesperson, so it is uncertain if the iPhone 7 that exploded was still in its shipping box or was plugged in for a charging cycle.The BGR posted user comments seem to indicate that the iPhone 7 device exploded in its shipping box. That could trigger an\u00a0automatic recall for all iPhone 7 devices, if the explosion is confirmed.Public transportation systems around the world, including the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority, have taken a hard line on\u00a0the recalled\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Note 7 by telling passengers on airplanes, trains, subways and buses to not to use\u00a0the smartphones due to the risk of dangerous fires.Because Samsung caught the issue quickly, it has\u00a0successfully recalled about 65 percent, or 1 million units, of the Galaxy Note 7 phablets shipped in late August and early September.But the scale of a potential iPhone 7 recall could be epic. According to a report in Digitimes, \u201csources from Taiwan-based touch panel makers\u201d say that\u00a0Apple\u00a0has just boosted \u201cpart and component orders for iPhone 7 devices\u201d by about 20 to 30 percent above what the company had originally planned.Digitimes\u2019 sources estimate that iPhone 7 shipments from the iPhone maker\u2019s contract manufacturing partners during the second half of 2016 should come in somewhere between 80 million and 84 million units.The last major iPhone controversy was in the form of #bendgate, where iPhone 6 Plus units started to go out of shape in users\u2019 pockets. Apple resolved the problem quickly by replacing the materials for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus with a sturdier build of aluminum. But there was never any danger of injury to a user that mandated an immediate recall.The report of an iPhone 7 exploding is only an isolated incident right now. But the new iPhone 7s have a greater concentration of battery cells, several upgrades on board, a dual camera for the first time in iPhone history, and a new and more powerful A10 Fusion chip.Breitbart California, Economics, Tech, #bendgate, exploding iPhone, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone recallComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak29 Sep 20160Perhaps Cruz\u00a0should have done so before the Republican\u00a0convention in July. And perhaps he has his own political ambitions in mind. Nevertheless, it is never too late to do the right thing. And it is better to do\u00a0the right thing, even if for the wrong reason, than not. Trump should do the same \u2014 as should we all, in our own lives.This Sunday through Tuesday\u00a0evening, we Jews will celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.\u00a0Traditionally, the weeks leading up to Rosh Hashanah are a time for moral reflection, and for asking forgiveness from those whom we may have wronged during the course of the year, as well as from God. The annual process of repentance and reconciliation accelerates on Rosh Hashanah, and culminates on\u00a0the fast day of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, ten days later (Oct. 11-12).Earlier this year, in the throes of a Twitter debate about the alt-right, Commentary\u2018s John Podhoretz pulled religious rank on me,\u00a0telling me I\u2019d have much to repent for this Yom Kippur. I laughed it off at the time, but it\u2019s not an unfair question to ask oneself: Have I said or done anything to wrong others, in\u00a0this contentious year?I\u2019ve thought about that, and in the spirit of the season, I\u2019ve written to several people to apologize \u2014 regardless of whether they reciprocate. (I\u2019ve had a couple of nice replies.)I\u2019ve also decided to forgive people for things they said in anger, or in error. There is little point to holding grudges, especially political ones.\u00a0I\u2019ve tangled often with the NeverTrump crowd on Twitter, for example, but when I look at some of their posts, I find I agree with 99% of everything else most\u00a0of them write.If people who share that much in common cannot look past a single political disagreement, then there is little hope for the conservative movement \u2014 or for America as a whole, frankly.My friend Guy Benson wrote a column\u00a0recently considering the question of blame, in the event that Donald Trump loses the election in November (though it looks, increasingly, like his chances are improving). Guy was defending himself, and other critics of Trump, from the argument that they will be to blame, so I do not want to be harsh in criticizing his approach.\u00a0And I agree with him: if Trump loses, it won\u2019t be NeverTrump\u2019s fault. (There are too few of them in any case.)But I disagree with Guy\u00a0when he argues that others should, in fact, be blamed instead \u2014 \u201c[t]hose who actively aided and abetted Trump\u2019s rise, and who used their conservative credibility to promulgate the fiction that he is something other than what he has clearly demonstrated himself to be over several decades of public life.\u201d He adds later: \u201cA Trump loss would rest squarely on the shoulders of the candidate, his campaign, and the people who thought it was a good idea to nominate him\u201d\u00a0(emphasis added).It is unclear to me why people who simply argue for\u00a0a candidate bear moral culpability.\u00a0People have the right to advocate and vote for a candidate. We are allowed to be wrong.Guy\u2019s argument would make more sense on the Democratic side, where the party leaders\u00a0actively colluded to ensure no one but Hillary Clinton could win the nomination. They\u00a0are morally responsible if she loses \u2014 and also if she wins. But Trump ran\u00a0against the party. He won the nomination with votes alone.It is difficult to see what benefit can come from assigning blame to either side of the pro-Trump/NeverTrump divide. Politics is ultimately a game of numbers: why would you want fewer allies?There is more to gain from forgiveness than from blame. I would save\u00a0moral\u00a0outrage\u00a0for those people \u2014 thankfully,\u00a0few \u2014 who behave dishonestly in pushing their views, or who insist on personal attacks rather than political arguments. (And even they deserve a chance \u2014 not indefinite, mind you \u2014 to repent.)After all, there is more that unites us conservatives than divides us, and the fights are both exhausting and pointless.\u00a0Norman Podhoretz recently came out\u00a0for Trump; is John Podhoretz expected\u00a0to dismiss\u00a0his own father?\u00a0It seems best for conservatives to forgive \u2014 and to start now, before the election. Winning, of course, would help\u00a0our divisions to subside, if not disappear.Regardless,\u00a0forgiveness has the moral power to\u00a0strengthen us, and our country \u2014 if we have the courage to offer and seek it.Joel B.

Gov. Jerry Brown has until the end of the month to sign or veto the measure.According to the Times:The documents are another indication of Ms. Harris\u2018 close relationship with Planned Parenthood and call into question the impartiality of her ongoing investigation of Mr. Daleiden, legal experts said.The emails show Beth Parker, chief legal counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, sending multiple drafts of AB 1671 to Jill Habig, who was at the time special counsel to the attorney general.\u201cAttached is the language for AB 1671, proposed amendments to Penal Code section 632,\u201d Ms. Parker wrote in an email marked March 8. \u201cI look forward to your thoughts about this.\u201dMs. Parker sent a revised draft of the legislation to Ms. Habig on March 16. \u201cHere\u2019s the rewrite of the video tape bill,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet me know what you think.\u201dHabig is now deputy manager of Harris\u2019 U.S. Senate campaign.

Instead, the player blames his dwindling weight on his recovery from injuries.Whatever the cause, 49ers coach Chip Kelly noted that Kaepernick needs to return to his playing weight before he\u2019ll be considered for a shot at more game time.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready to go full time,\u201d the coach said this week, quoted by ESPN. \u201cHe\u2019s continuing to work on it. \u2026 And Kap will be the first to tell you, if you guys have been around here before, I think his playing weight has been around 225, and he\u2019s not at that right now. So he\u2019s going out there and continuing to work, continuing to get better. He had a serious layoff in terms of being able to medical rehab. To get the full Kap for what you need, the potential that he has, he needs to continue to just work on the physical aspect of things.\u201dKaepernick tried to further explain his predicament.\u201cI think the fact that my weight isn\u2019t where it was,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cMy strength is still growing, developing, but once again I\u2019m always going to be prepared, always ready to put it on the line for this team.\u201dThe 49ers number seven also noted that he was starting a new diet of vegan-friendly protein shakes and other weight-gain supplements in an effort to regain his\u00a0playing weight. He also claimed he is already back up to his former running speed.The player\u2019s veganism, though, is a major departure from his past comments about veggies. Back in 2013 Kaepernick slammed veggies in an Instagram photo of a meal of steak, eggs and fruit with a caption reading: \u201cThis is lunch\u2026.. I don\u2019t eat vegetables they make you weak!\u201dKaepernick made other news earlier this week when he said the United States was never great, as\u00a0a rejoinder to GOP nominee Donald Trump.\u201cHe always says, \u2018Make America great again,'\u201d Kaepernick said of Trump. \u201cWell, America has never been great for people of color and that\u2019s something that needs to be addressed.

But social media and telecommunications investors recognize Twitter\u2019s potential value as a platform to\u00a0distribute video directly, as \u201ccord-cutting\u201d spreads from millennials to older demographic groups.Television cord-cutting has continued over the last four years with, just 76 percent of households paying for cable television connections at the end of 2015, according to a\u00a0Pew Research survey. About 15 percent of households have cut the cord and 9 percent are so-called \u201ccord-nevers,\u201d who have never signed up for cable TV.That was not a problem for cable companies like Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC), because they made up for lost TV revenue by charging more for broadband Internet connections, imposing usage caps and offering online package deals.But a Pew revealed that only 67 percent of homes are paying for broadband Internet connections this year, down from 70 percent in 2013. The results mark the first time in decades that the reach of wired Internet shrank among households. The main driver for the contraction is that 13 percent of households now report they are \u201csmartphone only,\u201d up from 8 percent two years earlier. The motivation for eliminating broadband connections is similar to the rational for getting rid of cable television, i.e. money.According to SunTrust\u2019s top-ranked Internet analyst Bob Peck,\u00a0a Twitter deal could happen for around $27 per share, or about 20 percent higher than the current $22 a share. He basis his estimate on the 30-, 60- and 90-day stock price moving averages after a\u00a040 percent take-out premium. That generates a $27, $26, and $24 stock price, very close to Twitter\u2019s original $26 initial public offering price. But that also values the company at $25 billion, a very high comparative market valuation of about 6.1 times revenue and 22 times the earning before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of debt.Aged 18-36-year-old subscribers to Netflix are nearing cable\u2019s subscription numbers for those. Statista analytics predicts that this cord-cutting trend is beginning to be embraced by older demographics, creating an existential threat to cable\u2019s business model.In response, analysts at J.P. Morgan recently boosted their price targets by $1 trillion on the four so-called \u201cFANG\u201d stocks: Facebook\u00a0(NASDAQ:FB) to $175, from $170; Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) to $1,000, from $925; Netflix\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) to $125, from $116; and Alphabet (Google) to $1,025, from $950.Twitter stock trended upward on the news. But Disney\u2019s stock traded down because their ESPN and ABC media units lack an in-house social media platform to continue to amplify their audience reach.Twitter\u2019s live streaming efforts with companies like the NFL and its own Periscope platform are the only innovative features that are sparking buy-out interest from Disney and others.Disney has significant advantages over other bidders to acquire Twitter. First, Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey serves on Disney\u2019s Board of Directors. But the biggest advantage is that Disney owns a 33 percent stake in BAMTech, the tech spinout from Major League Baseball that owns the app powering Twitter\u2019s streaming of NFL games\u00a0on the web.That means there would be virtually no \u201chard tech\u201d integration problems for Disney to leverage combining its content with the live streams and commentary being experimentally demonstrated by Twitter for ESPN\u2019s broadcast of Thursday Night Football.Big Hollywood, Breitbart California, Tech, Alphabet, Amazon, ATT, BAMTech, Bob Peck, cord cutting, cord never, Disney, facebook, FANG, Google, hard tech, Jack Dorsey, Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce.com, smartphone only, synergy, Twitter, Twitter CEO, VerizonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street28 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0Breitbart News reported in \u201cMaking Humans a Multiplanetary Species\u201d that Musk had told the high-tech Code Conference in June 2016 that when he first established\u00a0Space Exploration Technologies Corp.\u00a0(SpaceX) in 2002, the\u00a0prime mission\u00a0of the company was to colonize Mars. He\u00a0replied to conference doubters that he could do it: \u201cThat\u2019s the game plan \u2014 approximately 2024 to launch the first of the Mars colonial transport systems with people.\u201dMusk began his September 26 keynote address to the International Astronautical Congress by reminding the conference audience \u2014 including\u00a0the world\u2019s top rocket, satellite and military planners \u2014 that he was serious when he famously had said, \u201cI\u2019d like to die on Mars, just not on impact.\u201dMusk revealed that SpaceX\u00a0is designing a powerful new rocket system called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) to accelerate his Mars landing. SpaceX plans first to launch an empty Mars vehicle into an Earth orbit in 2022, then refuel and stock it with supplies over the span of multiple follow-on launches between Earth and the orbiting rocket.Once resupplied, ITS boasters will power the now manned vehicle on a course to Mars that will take between 80 to 160 days, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.The radically disruptive innovation is SpaceX\u2019s plan that after its vehicle lands and colonizes Mars, the crew will produce, among other things, the rocket propellant to make the return journey back to Earth.The ITS rocket will have a lift capability of putting 610 tons of payload into low-earth orbit, about 30 times SpaceX\u2019s current Falcon 9 rocket, which has a capacity of only 26 tons, and 10 times SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket, which is set to fly in 2017.Musk acknowledged that the most conservative estimates put the price of his Mars mission at $10 billion per person. Given that at least 100 people could travel in each ITS mission, that equates to what has been a prohibitive $1 trillion price tag to go to Mars.But Musk emphasized four innovative features of the SpaceX scheme: the reusability of ITS boosters and refueling tanks; refueling in orbit; producing propellant on Mars; and plans to use a more optimal propellant like super-cooled methane. Collectively, Musk believes these four features could push costs as low as $200,000 per person, or about $20 billion for the mission.Prior to Musk\u2019s keynote speech, funding a Mars mission had been considered the most daunting challenge in space due to its requirement of scaling up the project\u2019s massive resource needs on SpaceX\u2019s own profits and financing platforms like Kickstarter.But with Musk promising to rely on participation from the private sector to colonize Mars, Musk may have just kicked off the greatest land rush since the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act, which\u00a0chartered the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific Railroad Companies to build a transcontinental railroad linking the United States from east to west within 25 years.Tthe rail project was completed in 7 years as the companies raced, building track to capture the greatest amount of 10-mile alternating sections of real estate along all the railway they completed. As a measure of the spectacular economic stimulus of the Transcontinental Railroad, the cost\u00a0of cross-country travel dropped from $1,000 prior to the completion in Promontory, Utah on May 10, 1969, to just $150 dollars.Although the wonder of space travel was the focus of Musk\u2019s presentation to the international scientists, business and military analysts instantly recognized that if SpaceX succeeds, the United States will be positioned to gain solar system economic and militarily omnipotence for at least the next 30 years.Breitbart California, National Security, Tech, Elon Musk, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, I\u2019d like to Die on Mars, ITS, Just Not on Impact, Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species, Mars, military dominance, military omnipotence, SpaceX, Transcontinental RailroadComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Or, rather, new lows, as the average depth of a new breed of safe haven that occupies thousands of square feet is 10 feet under or more.

Blake Farenthold (R-TX) posed at a House Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday focused on oversight of FBI operations.Although the FBI director acknowledged he found \u201cevidence\u201d that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton might have violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, he determined earlier this year there was insufficient proof of intent to prosecute\u00a0her.He came to that conclusion after finding that Clinton acted \u201cextremely carelessly\u201d in handling classified information on her private email as President Barack Obama\u2019s Secretary of State.On Wednesday, Rep. Farenthold asked:How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how an average Americans would be treated, this only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?The FBI director said in responding:Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts. Now you\u2019d be in trouble, that\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve had to explain to the FBI workforce. If you use an unclassified email system to do our business and in the course of doing our business talk about classified topics, you would be in big trouble with the FBI. I\u2019m highly confident of that. I\u2019m also highly confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted.In a joking manner, Rep. Farenthold suggested he would cite Comey\u2019s response if he were to get in trouble for mishandling classified information.Something similar is already occurring in the court rooms.\u201cI\u2019m confident that you wouldn\u2019t [be prosecuted]\u2026 Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it, but I guess I can\u2019t control Congress. If you work for us don\u2019t do it,\u201d reiterated Comey in response to the Congressman\u2019s question, later adding:You can call us wrong. You can call me a fool. You cannot call us weasels, okay. That is just not fair. We hopefully have not gotten to a place in public life where everything has to be torn down on integrity basis just to disagree. You can disagree with this\u00a0\u2014 there is just not a fair basis for saying that we did it [handled Clinton\u2019s email scandal] in any way that wasn\u2019t honest and independent.Some government employees, including members of the military, have been prosecuted in connection to cases similar to the one that involved Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.A lawyer representing Maj. Jason Brezler, a decorated U.S. Marine who is being discharged for sending classified information on his personal email account, has now said he intends to cite the precedent set by Clinton\u2019s case as part of his defense approach.Meanwhile, U.S. Navy Petty Officer First Class Kristian Saucier cited the Hillary Clinton precedent in his defense, but was still convicted on a felony charge for taking photos of classified systems inside a submarine and sentenced to one year in prison and a $100 fine.In July, Comey said that it would be a \u201cdouble standard\u201d to prosecute Clinton.The director elaborated on that point when questioned by Farenthold.Without explicitly denying the existence of new evidence, Comey maintained Wednesday that Clinton did not break any laws, adding that he is not planning on reopening the FBI case against her.Comey\u2019s entire response to the Republican Congressman\u2019s question about whether average Americans would be treated any differently by the FBI if they mishandled classified information in the same manner that she did:When people tell you that, that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases. Because I made a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor. I have gone back through 40 years of cases and I\u2019m telling you under oath that to treat\u2013 to prosecute on these facts, would be a double standard because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts. Now you\u2019d be in trouble. That\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve had to explain to the FBI workforce. You use an unclassified email system to do our business and in the course of doing our business talk about classified topics, you would be in big trouble with the FBI.

Pollak28 Sep 20160It is\u00a0just the latest in a series of steps that Obama has taken to undermine American power, regardless of the consequences. And just like the failed Russian \u201creset,\u201d the Libya war, the Iraq pullout\u00a0and the Iran deal, it is doomed to failure, and irreversible.At the\u00a0New York Times, Danielle Kehl of New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute attempts to make the best case for the handover. She argues that the U.S. always intended to give up control of ICANN, that ICANN works well enough to be given up, and that the new multi-stakeholder model is preferable to one in which governments exert direct control of ICANN.All of these arguments fall apart rather easily. The U.S. may have intended to give up ICANN when it was created, but it has become a strategic asset, and the U.S. will not break\u00a0any legal or binding commitment by holding onto it. ICANN does not work well enough to be trusted. Earlier this month, the Free Beacon cited congressional testimony in reporting that ICANN has \u201chas provided official accreditation to people who have transferred technology to Iran, worked with North Korea, and ordered \u201cmurders-for-hire.\u201d Clearly more needs to be done to strengthen accountability and transparency before any change.As for whether the multi-stakeholder model is preferable to the government-dominated model the rest of the world prefers, that is the same fallacious argument the administration used in pushing the Iran deal \u2014 i.e.\u00a0allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons in the future is better than no deal at all. The best alternative of all is the status quo.Congress has only three days to stop Obama\u2019s surrender of ICANN.

Witnesses had called police to complain that the couple appeared to be having sex in a parked car on the premises.As heard in\u00a0audio recorded during the encounter, Watts repeatedly refused to provide identification to Parker when asked; the actress, who is black, also accused Parker of racial discrimination, because her boyfriend is white.The Ethics Commission initiated a complaint against Parker for leaking audio of the incident to gossip outlet TMZ. The officer was charged with violating a confidentiality agreement and was ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing, but Parker \u2014 a 26-year veteran of the LAPD \u2014 chose to resign instead.In testimony at a downtown courthouse on Monday, Parker reiterated that\u00a0he publicized the audio tape in an effort to clear his name, as he said his superiors failed to support him as allegations of racism continued to mount, the Los Angeles Times reported.L.A. Ethics Commission director of enforcement Sergio Perez reportedly said Monday that Parker had violated the law and that he knew what he had done \u201cwas wrong.\u201dLarry Hanna, an attorney for\u00a0Parker, said that the now-retired officer had simply done what other officers have done in the past, and was being singled out by the department because he had attempted to defend himself.In filing the complaint against Parker in August, the Ethics Commission had said the officer could pay a $2,500 fine to settle the case, or else go to trial. Parker\u2019s attorney told TMZ that month that the officer would take the case to trial.Watts and Lucas were charged with lewd conduct in October 2014 and pled no contest to a charge of disturbing the peace in May of the following year. As part of their settlement, the couple were ordered to perform 40 hours of community service and to write apology letters to Parker for insinuating the arrest was based on racial discrimination.Watts had previously refused to apologize to the officer, even as several civil rights leaders accused the actress of \u00a0\u201ccrying wolf\u201d over the incident.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, Breitbart California, Daniele Watts, indecent exposure, Jim Parker, LAPD, Los Angeles Ethics Commission, racism, TMZComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Badawi was also found guilty of a single count of financial aid fraud for \u201cusing his federal financial aid to purchase a plane ticket for Elhuzayel to travel to Turkey,\u201d according to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.United States District Judge David O. Carter said of Elhuzayel as he imposed the sentence, \u201cThere\u2019s no remorse, no repudiation of ISIL, only death and destruction.\u201d Judge Carter went on to recount Elhuzayel\u2019s repeated calls for martyrdom that he said make him \u201cespecially dangerous.\u201dBreitbart News previously reported:A recorded conversation of the two caught them discussing \u201chow it would be a blessing to fight for the cause of Allah, and to die in the battlefield,\u201d while referring to ISIS as \u201cwe.\u201d Badawi also discussed support for the Islamic terror group, and violence against non-Muslims, on Facebook. Elhuzayel used the ISIS flag as his Facebook profile photo, according to the USAO.Courtroom documents reveal: \u201cOn October 21, 2014, defendant Badawi made a video of defendant Elhuzayel in which defendant Elhuzayel swore allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and pledged to travel to Syria to be an ISIS fighter.\u201dElhuzayel\u2019s lawyer, Pal Lengyel-Leahu, tried to liken his client\u2019s online posts advocating for ISIS to picking sides between baseball teams like the Yankees and Red Sox,\u00a0according to NBC Los Angeles. Lengyel-Leahu said Elhuzayel was an Israeli citizen and was flying to meet a woman he met online to get married.Elhuzayel was caught\u00a0as he was about to board a plane at Los Angeles International Airport to travel to Turkey to join ISIS. The final destination of that flight was Israel; however, it had a layover in Istanbul where he planned to stay without\u00a0boarding the connecting flight. Badawi bought that plane ticket and was recorded telling someone that he planned to join ISIS soon as well. Evidence at trial was presented showing Badawi \u201cencouraged other associates to support ISIL and participate in violent jihad,\u201d as Deirdre Fike, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office, previously said of the convictions.\u201cThere can be no doubt that law enforcement\u2019s disruption of their plans saved lives, both in the United States and abroad,\u201d said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker.A Department of Justice release stated:The trial evidence also showed that Elhuzayel used social media to communicate with ISIL supporters and operatives, to disseminate pro-ISIL information, and to assist ISIL supporters by distributing social media account information for those whose accounts had been suspended.Evidence at trial also showed the Elhuzayel wrote to Islamic terror attacker Elton Simpson over social media on the day that Simpson carried out an attack in Garland, Texas: \u201cI love you for the sake of Allah brother may Allah grant you Jannat al ferdaus [the highest level of Paradise reserved for martyrs].\u201dElhuzayel also \u201creceived and disseminated social media communications from ISIL operative Abu Hussain al Britani, also known as Junaid Hussain, including communications trumpeting the Garland, Texas, shootings. On May 7, 2015, four days after the Garland shootings, Elhuzayel and Badawi made travel arrangements and purchased Elhuzayel\u2019s plane ticket to join ISIL,\u201d according to the DOJ release.Badawi is scheduled for sentencing on October 17.

The\u00a0Bee notes that he has been\u00a0arrested multiple times in recent years. After being\u00a0hit in the face with the pie, Mayor Johnson reportedly punched Thompson in the face and also sat\u00a0on him in order to restrain him.Thompson also appeared in court on a felony charge of assaulting a public official, and a misdemeanor charge of battery on school property. However, the\u00a0Bee reports that he did not enter a plea for those charges during his arraignment hearing. A preliminary hearing was reportedly set for October 20 in Sacramento Superior Court.Mayor Johnson\u00a0reportedly said he did nothing wrong when he punched Thompson in reaction to having the pie smashed into his face. \u201cWhen somebody comes up from behind you and slugs you \u2013 and in my case you didn\u2019t know what it was at the time and thought it was a punch \u2013 you have a right to defend yourself,\u201d Johnson\u00a0said on Monday.Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Crystal Strait, reportedly said, \u201cLet me be clear, the mayor was assaulted.\u201d The Bee notes that the\u00a0Police Department said it was unlikely Johnson would face charges.On Monday, Thompson\u00a0said he decided to carry out the pie stint because\u00a0he found out that Johnson\u2019s mayoral term would be ending soon and wanted to do whatever he could, in the remaining time, to \u201cbring some public spotlight to these issues. I was going to do what I could. And it just so happened that the circumstances were right. I came upon him at his event and I was able to put a pie in his face.\u201d\nHe added that he\u00a0chose coconut cream pie because there was a chance he might have backed out at the last minute and noted that he really likes that flavor of pie.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNazBreitbart California, Weird News, activist, coconut cream pie, Kevin Johnson, Mayor Kevin Johnson, Oak Park, occupy, pie in the face, Sacramento Charter High School, Sean ThompsonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak27 Sep 20160The good news for Trump fans is the Republican nominee is likely to win the next two debates \u2014 the town hall at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 9, and \u201cFight Night\u201d\u00a0at the University of\u00a0Nevada, Las Vegas on Oct. 19. The only question is whether those later debates will affect early voting.There are five\u00a0basic reasons Trump will win the second and third debates.1. Expectations. The candidate that beats expectations by the widest margin wins the debate. As I explained in previewing the first debate, Trump originally had far lower expectations. But Clinton\u2019s health problems, which theoretically should have made the debate more difficult for her to endure, helped her by lowering expectations\u00a0to her benefit: all she had to do was to stand up straight for 90 minutes and she would win. Now that she has won Round 1, Trump is the underdog for the next two.2. Moderators.\u00a0Lester Holt was terrible \u2014 more biased against Trump than CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley was against Romney in 2012. (Crowley intervened to save the Democrat once; Holt did so\u00a0at least five times.) Holt will face well-deserved criticism from the right, which will serve as a warning to the remaining moderators. Moreover, no one else is as inexperienced as Holt. The second debate will feature\u00a0Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper \u2014\u00a0both on the left, but with experience asking\u00a0Hillary Clinton about issues Holt ignored, like Clinton\u2019s\u00a0e-mail scandal. The final debate will feature Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, who is\u00a0typically fair. CBS News\u2019 Elaine Quijano, who will moderate the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 4 in FarmVille, VA , is new to debates, but is\u00a0a\u00a0straight shooter who\u00a0will leave the candidates alone.\u00a0(Full disclosure: she went to my high school.)3. Town hall format.\u00a0Trump is simply better than Clinton at facing real, live voters. While Clinton\u2019s campaign has\u00a0carefully curated her interactions with the public, Trump has been mixing it up with rough crowds for more than a year. Moreover, it is clear from the first debate that Clinton is focused on attacking Trump, while he focuses\u00a0on the bigger picture (when he is not defending himself). The town hall format will allow him to \u201cgo high when they go low,\u201d to paraphrase Michelle Obama.4. Las Vegas. Trump has home field advantage in the final debate.\u00a0Arguably, his best debate of the Republican primary was in Las Vegas, a city that is a second home to the Trump family. No\u00a0one knows a Fight Night like the Donald: he will come out aggressively, regardless of where he stands in the polls by then. This will not be a repeat of Mitt Romney\u2019s wilt-to-the-finish.5. Bonus for improvement.\u00a0He may not have won the first debate, but Trump removed the risk that he would implode. And as he sharpens his performance over the next two debates, Trump will enjoy an additional benefit: voters will see him improve in real time, providing a demonstration of how quickly he would learn to do his job in the White House.Provided he combines his new, calm demeanor with a sharper focus on his best issues, like immigration, Trump will finish on top.Joel B.

Street27 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0For the last five years, the high tech communities of Silicon Valley, Seattle and the Los Angeles\u2019s Silicon Beach have led the nation in rent inflation. But recently the nationwide average cost of rent has also begun to creep up faster than inflation, with the average rental cost of a one-bedroom-apartment rising from $932 in August to $940 in September.A new Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University\u00a0analysis of American Community Survey data found that 49.3 percent, or about 21.3 million American renters, reported being \u201ccost-burdened,\u201d meaning they paid 30 percent or more of their income in rent and utilities. A quarter of U.S. renters were \u201cseverely cost burdened,\u201d which means they were paying at least 50 percent of their income on housing costs.But the Abodo National Apartment Report indicates that America may be on the verge of a huge trend change in rent inflation as San Jose, San Francisco, Long Beach and Los Angeles made the Top 10 list for \u201cBiggest Fall\u201d in rents for a one-bedroom apartment.The Abodo website documents that among U.S. cities, the fastest falling rent cost was Seattle, plunging 13 percent, from $2,170 to $1,890. San Jose saw the second-largest decrease, with rent plunging from $2,790 to $2,455, a 12 percent decline.Los Angeles rents fell 8 percent \u2014 the third largest decline in America. Long Beach rents fell by 7 percent \u2014 the sixth largest fall,\u00a0according to Abodo. San Francisco, the most expensive rental market in the nation, saw rent cost fall by 6 percent, from $3,952 to $3,698 \u2014 the seventh-largest decline.On the other hand, three low-wage inland California cities that enjoyed some of the least expensive rent in the state made the Abodo\u2019s Top 10 list for \u201cBiggest Rise\u201d in rents last month: 1) \u00a0Bakersfield \u2014 up 9 percent;\u00a0Fresno \u2014 up 6 percent; and Riverside \u2014 up 6 percent.Breitbart California, Economics, Tech, housing inflation, rent, rental inflation, Silicon Beach, silicon valleyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But Spiegel told the Wall Street Journal that \u00a0when holding the device at arms length to record or forward real-time video, the experience is \u201clike a wall in front of your face.\u201dSnapchat\u2019s disruptive social media business innovation was allowing users to share words and images that disappeared after a short period or the first opening. That addressed the prime risk to its precocious teenage users of \u201cPAW,\u201d kid-speak for \u201cparents are watching.\u201dIn the 2016 battle among the social networks to attract new users, Snapchat is again stomping all competition with a 27 percent growth rate, passing\u00a0Twitter\u2019s daily users by 15 million.According to Cathy Boyle, eMarketer.com\u2019s principal analyst, Snapchat\u2019s \u201chighly visual interface and the features that enable users to get creative with the images they share, and tailor them to specific locations or events.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe fun aspect of Snapchat should also be credited for its success. In a world in which there is an app for nearly everything, Snapchat has cut through the clutter by injecting fun back into social sharing.\u201dIt should not be surprising that Snapchat\u2019s short-lived messages and fun features are especially attractive to users in the 12-to-34-year old age group, the exact youth demographic to which\u00a0marketers crave access. About a third of Snapchat\u2019s U.S. user base is between 18 and 24, followed by 27 percent for Americans between 25 and 34. But the company\u2019s fastest growing age group segment is people under 12, which is estimated to grow at a stunning 42.9 percent this year.Snapchat engages in more intimate one-to-one or one-to-few communication, as opposed to Facebook\u2019s broadcast-style sharing across an entire network, according to Boyle. She suggests, \u201cThis desire is particularly strong among millennials and younger consumers who don\u2019t have strong ties to the traditional social networks.\u201dSeveral years ago, Google tried to introduce Google Glass. Although the glasses had a camera, the product failed because it was more like offering a \u201cheads-up-display\u201d to geeky 40 year-old engineers who want continuous access to their desktops for data.Although Spiegel says he has been working for the last two years to develop a more true-to-life experience to record and transmit video, Spectacles priced at $129.99 are, most importantly, hip sunglasses that come in the fashion colors of black, coral and teal.By taping on the side of the sunglasses, Spectacles record up to 10 seconds of video from the wearer\u2019s perspective. Each additional tap adds another clip, but each recording starts with a ring of tiny lights around the camera that lets other people know from a privacy perspective that they are potentially being recorded.The front-corner camera uses a 115-degree-angle lens that creates a picture field-of-view that is more like the human eye\u2019s natural lens. That, in turn, creates video experiences that are more like circular human vision than traditional square camera pics, which use square formatting for printed images. The hands-free design allows users\u00a0to pet dogs, hug babies, or dance around at concerts. Spiegel says that allows users to reach their arms out to people they are filming, rather than extending a camera.Snapchat Spectacles were initially panned, with lots of nasty comments after a review by the Wall Street Journal blog, probably reflecting the older age of readers. But comments on viral youth sites like marysue.com and thenextweb.com indicate that Snapchat\u2019s first hardware product is going viral, and could generate huge demand from Snapchat\u2019s prime demographic.Breitbart California, Tech, disruptive, facebook, Google Glass, Inc.'

Pollak26 Sep 20160The lawsuit, filed and announced Monday by the Department of Labor, threatens the complete cancellation of every contract Palantir has with the federal government \u2014 a penalty worth $340 million, the lawsuit\u00a0claims,\u00a0which would end the company.The claims in the lawsuit are laughable. The Obama administration\u00a0alleges that Palantir discriminated against Asians. But it has to admit that Palantir, in fact, hired many Asians \u2014 11 out of 25 software engineers, for example. The government does not even bother to claim that Palantir deliberately excluded Asians. Rather, it argues\u00a0that\u00a0since only 44% of Palantir\u2019s software engineers are Asian, but 85% of the applicant pool was Asian, Palantir must, statistically, have discriminated against Asians.In other words: almost all of the software engineers at Palantir have to be Asian, or else it is guilty of \u201cracial discrimination.\u201d Apparently left-wing concern for \u201cdiversity\u201d in the workplace is a flexible concept, based on political expediency.(It is notoriously difficult for anyone, Asian or otherwise, to be hired by Palantir, which deals with very\u00a0sensitive and advanced intelligence-oriented projects \u2014 a fact that is well-known in the tech, defense, and public policy communities.)The lawsuit is obvious\u00a0revenge\u00a0for Thiel\u2019s support of Trump. In his speech at the Republican National Convention in July, Thiel blasted the government for its technological backwardness: \u201c[T]oday our government is broken\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it would be kind to say the government\u2019s software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn\u2019t even work at all.\u201dThiel\u2019s government clients\u00a0clearly did not take kindly to that\u00a0\u2014 and wanted to send a message to other potential Trump fans in the business and tech communities.One expert interviewed by the\u00a0San Jose Mercury News was highly skeptical of the lawsuit\u2019s merits:\u201cThis is unusual,\u201d said Buck Gee, a former Cisco executive who studies Asian diversity in Silicon Valley, said of the accusations against Palantir. \u201cIf it\u2019s true, it would be an anomaly.\u201dBut Gee said Asian employees are less likely to be promoted once they are hired. At Facebook, for example, just 21 percent of the company\u2019s senior leadership staff is Asian.As for the Palantir lawsuit, Gee is skeptical about the discrimination claims. The complaint leaves out key information, he said, such as what percentage of the company\u2019s overall workforce is Asian. And the Labor Department didn\u2019t explain how it determined which rejected applicants were qualified for the engineering jobs in question.The Department of Labor hopes\u00a0to weaponize\u00a0the Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous ruling last year in Texas Housing\u00a0on so-called \u201cdisparate impact\u201d discrimination\u00a0to bully Thiel and others.

According to a report by the Daily Beast, Luckey gave $10,000 to Nimble America, a self-described \u201csocial welfare 501(c)4 non-profit\u201d in support of the Republican presidential nominee.The 24-year-old virtual reality pioneer told The Daily Beast that he has been active on Reddit\u2019s r/The_Donald page, a community where the rule is \u201cno dissenters,\u201d and where he posted under the pseudonym \u201cNimbleRichMan,\u201d a password given to him by the organization\u2019s founders.The Daily Beast claims that Luckey was first hooked up with Nimble America through Breitbart\u2019s sensational tech editor, Milo Yiannopoulos.Nimble America is careful not to mention support for Trump directly (and Luckey now says he backs Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson). Instead, Nimble America is creating conservative content and posting high impact videos on its website that warn of the economic dangers to middle class wages from illegal immigration, and how crony capitalists are the primary\u00a0beneficiaries of trade agreements like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.In an effort to gain economic advantage\u00a0through crony federal government relationships, Silicon Valley tech CEOs now make about 83 percent of their political contributions to Democrats.

Street26 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0Polonsky v. Wells Fargo Bank & Co.\u00a0was filed by Los Angeles based Jonathon J. Delshad of the Law Offices of Jonathon Delshad, PC in the California Superior Court, Los Angeles County on behalf of 2 ex-employees. It seeks class action status to represent up to 5,300 former employees allegedly fired by Wells Fargo for opening accounts without the individual account owner\u2019s permission.Such a huge class action lawsuit is usually handled on a contingency basis by a law firm that has financial deep pockets and broad legal resources. But Delshad\u2019s one-horse-firm\u2019s website lists his most important prior cases as 1) 32 Year Bus Driver sues Los Angeles Metro (MTA); 2) Employee files retaliation claim against The Painted Nail; 3) Employee alleges retaliation for reporting employer to social services; and 4) EstrellaTV Anchorwoman files sexual harassment in the workplace.The Polonsky California lawsuit is on behalf of two former low-level Wells Fargo employees who were fired or demoted because they refused to break the law in order to meet new account sales quotas, according to Bloomberg.Despite sparse\u00a0details in the suit on how low-level bankers were illegally pushed through incentives to create at least 10 new accounts a day, a number of U.S. Senators last week demanded the resignation of Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf.Senior bankers are alleged to have \u201ccoached\u201d branch tellers and others secretly to open fee-generating accounts. Because the quotas were so high, branch employees are alleged to have resorted to using false customer contact information like NoName@WellsFargo.com, so they could keep their jobs, according to the complaint.Employees were allegedly\u00a0rewarded with promotions for using tactics including \u201csandbagging\u201d \u2014 opening fake accounts the day after a customer instructed the bank not to; \u201cpinning\u201d \u2014 assigning personal identification numbers without customer authorization; and \u201cbundling\u201d \u2014 lying to customers about the limited availability of certain products in packages.The lawsuit claims that despite Stumpf\u2019s role in orchestrating the allegedly dishonest practices, 5,300 Wells employees were fired when they were\u00a0caught opening bogus accounts without client approval.The biggest problem with the Polonsky suit is that it simply repackages customer fraud allegations from a\u00a0complaint filed by the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office last year. That action was settled without Wells Fargo admitting any guilt.Bloomberg says the\u00a0Polonsky\u00a0suit tries to spin the L.A. Attorney\u2019s allegations to contend that the real victims of Wells\u2019 Fargo\u2019s evil business practices are employees demoted or terminated for not meeting sales targets.Yves Smith at the Naked Capitalism blog argues that the plaintiffs in Polonsky repeatedly make overly broad assertions that will not be hard for Wells Fargo to knock down in court. She is particularly\u00a0unimpressed by the following statement from the suit: \u201cIt is also illegal to engage in Securities Fraud by boosting the stock price as a result of conduct which one knows to be fraudulent, such as the scam perpetuated by Wells Fargo above.\u201dSmith, who worked on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co., comments, \u201cThat\u2019s not a legal argument. That\u2019s a hand wave.\u201d She adds that the filing also provides information that contradicts its unduly confident positions, such as \u201cEmployees who did not \u2018game\u2019 were surely denoted or fired,\u201d and \u201cBecause it was impossible to consistently meet a quota without \u2018gaming\u2019\u2026\u201d.For the latter to be true statement, \u201cevery single customer-facing employee who kept a job at Wells [must have] cheated.\u201d Smith believes that even if Wells Fargo had herculean sales targets, there must have been some employees that actually met them legitimately.CNN reported last week that whistleblowers said they were fired as a result of complaining. But both ex-employees admitted that Wells had a documented paper trail to justify the firings, because the ex-employees were often late to work.For the Polonsky lawsuit to move to the discovery phase, it will have to move past a major national law firm\u2019s motion for summary judgement, where the bank will argue that\u00a0there isn\u2019t enough with which\u00a0the court to bother. If Polonsky overcomes that hurdle, the plaintiffs\u00a0will still need to win class certification.Otherwise, Polonsky is just a wrongful termination suit by 2 ex-workers.Big Government, Breitbart California, class action, John Stumpf, Polonsky, Wells Fargo, wrongful terminationComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street25 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in an interview with California Healthline, quoted by Bay Area public radio station KQED, \u201cI think we should strongly consider a public option in California.\u201d The Sacramento Democrat added, \u201cIt will require a lot of careful thought and work, but I think it\u2019s something that ought to be on the table because we continue to see this consolidation in an already consolidated health insurance market.\u201dObamacare\u2019s goal was to wipe out private healthcare in America by demonstrating that through eliminating the profit motive, government could provide a higher standard of care at a lower price. But with private healthcare premiums increasing by only 5 percent in 2017, Obamacare\u2019s average premium cost is rising about 2.6 times faster, according to the National Business Group on Health, a Washington, D.C.-based organization representing 133\u00a0large employers.That does not include the cost for the failed state online healthcare shopping centers created by the 2010\u00a0Obamacare legislation. These\u00a0closed after receiving more than $1.3 billion in government loans to enroll more than 730,000 consumers across the 14 states.As of March 2016, Obamacare accounted for 11.1 million people that purchased health plans and the estimated 10 million people added to Medicaid nationally. California\u2019s Obamacare plan, called Covered California, accounted for about 1.1 million of the purchased plans, and over 4 million in Medicaid expansion.With California now providing Medicaid to about one-third of the state\u2019s population, Sen.\u00a0Ed Hernandez\u00a0(D-West Covina), who chairs the State Senate\u2019s Health Committee, estimates that the annual cost of the program has increased since 2012 by $30.8 billion per year, to $91 billion. But Hernandez calls that horrendous cost increase \u201ceconomic stimulus,\u201d since the State of California\u2019s cost under Obamacare only rose from $14.4 billion to $18 billion.When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a huge lead in July, she promised to \u201cpursue efforts to give Americans in every state in the country the choice of a public-option insurance plan.\u201dBut with the possibility\u00a0that Republican Donald Trump may become president and drastically cut back on Obamacare\u2019s spending Lollapalooza, California Democrats are now scrambling to form a state government-run health plan to compete with private plans.Insurance Commissioner Jones offered few details in a KQED\u00a0interview\u00a0regarding what the Golden State\u2019s \u201cpublic-option\u201d would look like, and how much it would cost. The second-term commissioner stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to begin to prejudge it,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you would start in certain areas of the state and expand from there. I think there would be significant reservations about the state running it. There would be a wide variety of governance models you could come up with.\u201dWith the Democrats potentially poised to pick up large enough majorities in both houses of the state legislature to pass bills without any bipartisan support in November, California lawmakers and their crony capitalist fellow travelers may have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a socialist paradise..\u201cWe\u2019re certainly very interested,\u201d Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, told KQED. \u201cThis is something we advocated for in its most ambitious form during the debate over health reform and there are elements of the proposal that could be adapted for California.\u201dHealth insurers agreed. \u201cCovered California has arguably one of the strongest and most stable exchanges in the country. There is robust consumer choice so we don\u2019t think we need to mess with something that isn\u2019t broken,\u201d said Nicole Evans, a spokeswoman for the California Association of Health Plans, a trade group.Commissioner Jones says he anticipates that critics will cite the\u00a0failure of numerous Obamacare co-ops across the country as evidence a public option won\u2019t work.

During the interview, it was determined\u00a0determined the man had illegally crossed the border from Mexico. They arrested him and took him to the Calexico Border Patrol Station for processing.A background records check on the Mexican national revealed he had previously been convicted in the United States for voluntary manslaughter and weapons charges.

Earlier this month, a Mexican national who had been deported five times returned yet again to allegedly begin a series of violent assaults and rapes of women in Austin, Texas. Federal prosecutors from the Western District of Texas declined to prosecute the man for illegal re-entry despite a request for prosecution from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from Enforcement Removal Operations.

Cetin was unarmed at his arrest, though he allegedly used three guns stolen from his father in the shooting.Bartiromo and McCaul discussed both attacks, and discussed possible terror links in the latter case:Bartiromo: There was a Washington mall shooter. He\u2019s been caught. The suspect was 20 years old. Turkish, Muslim, Arcan Cetin. He was arrested for murder of the five people he killed in the mall in Washington State. What can you tell us about him? Is this related to Islamic terrorism?McCaul: Well, I think there was a good chance it could be.

Street25 Sep 2016Newport Beach, CA0Musk stated at the Code Conference in June 2016 that when he first established Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) in 2002, the prime mission of the company was to colonize Mars.When asked if he would unveil his timetable for colonizing the \u201cRed Planet\u201d\u00a0at this year\u2019s international satellite and rocket convention, he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the game plan \u2014 approximately 2024 to launch the first of the Mars colonial transport systems with people.\u201dMusk acknowledged that the company is already developing a giant rocket, larger than the Saturn 5 moon rocket or the Space Launch System currently being pursued by NASA. But he has been tight-lipped about the design of the new rocket, and the location of its factory and launch base to make his dream a reality.SpaceX has not quantified the cost of what many still think is Musk\u2019s Martian madness. But he has said that SpaceX will need \u201ca lot of money\u201d for the project to come from revenues earned through lucrative contracts with NASA, the U.S. military, and commercial communications customers.As the highly anticipated keynote speaker for the second day of the conference, Musk promises he will detail the long-term technical challenges that the company needs to resolve in order to support the creation of a permanent, self-sustaining human presence on Mars. He also will focus on potential opportunities for industry, government and the scientific community to collaborate.Breitbart News noted in April of this year that SpaceX made a disruptive advance for space travel by launching a first-stage booster rocket into space, then landing the burnt out 14-story-tall rocket on a\u00a0floating drone ship\u00a0in the Atlantic Ocean. Over the next 5 months, SpaceX replicated the booster recovery landings three more times.SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell\u00a0estimated\u00a0that creating a reliable and reusable fist-stage rocket would only cost $40 million, net of $1 million in refueling and $3 million in refurbishment, versus the current $55 million cost of a single shot rocket.However, SpaceX recently suffered a costly\u00a0launch failure, while Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors electric vehicles and SolarCity energy-storage products are being buffeted by significant headwinds and blowing through massive amounts of cash\u00a0in a quest to build a \u201cGigafactory\u201d in the Nevada desert. Purported to be the largest factory in the world, the partners are racing to produce enough batteries to support the launch of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 mass-market car and SolarCity\u2019s stand-by electric utility back-ups.As chief executive officer of Tesla and the chairman and largest shareholder of SolarCity, Musk announced in early August that cash-rich Tesla would bid over $2 billion to acquire the heavily indebted SolarCity Corp. The deal has caused tremendous shareholder angst over potential insider conflicts and corporate governance risks.The Securities & Exchange Commission recently opened an investigation into the transaction\u2019s shareholder \u201cfairness.\u201d Premier short seller Jim Chanos has criticized the proposed merger as a \u201cwalking insolvency.\u201dMusk may be half genius and half unrealistic dreamer. But he is also one of the most relentlessly determined entrepreneurs in the history of the planet, and, perhaps soon, in the history of the universe.When one of SpaceX\u2019s\u00a0Falcon 9 rockets loaded with a Facebook communications satellite on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida\u00a0suffered a catastrophic explosion on September 1, Musk seemed unfazed by the loss of a $300 million satellite. He simply commented that from a technical perspective the disaster was \u201c[t]urning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.\u201dBreitbart California, Tech, 67th International Astronautical Congress, Elon Musk, gigafactory, Mars, NASA, Red Planet, SolarCity, Space, SpaceX, TeslaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He was reportedly unarmed at the time of his arrest. Law enforcement sources speculated that he may have acted from personal motives, given that his ex-girlfriend had once worked at the Macy\u2019s store where the shooting took place. The investigation is still ongoing, however.The Seattle Times reported that despite initial descriptions of a \u201cHispanic\u201d suspect, Cetin is of Turkish origin:Police said the suspect appeared to be a Hispanic male in his late teens to mid-20s with a close-shaved haircut. He used a long gun similar to a hunting rifle, Francis said.However, according to the Cetin\u2019s father\u2019s Facebook page, Cetin was born in Turkey. His father met and married Cetin\u2019s mother in Turkey and the family settled in Oak Harbor, according to the Facebook page.Local CBS News affiliate KIRO-7 reports that Cetin had a previous brush with the law for misdemeanor assault:In 2015, Cetin was involved in a fourth-degree assault case \u2014 a misdemeanor \u2014 in Island County. He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation in August 2015, and that was completed as of March 2016.There were also questions in the court file about cannabis use, but last April a judge has questions about how that related to his mental health evaluation, saying it was not a mental health issue.In May, a judge approved deferred prosecution in that assault case \u2014 meaning Cetin was not convicted \u2014 and he was ordered not to have alcohol or drugs.As of Aug. 25, 2016, Cetin was in compliance with weekly sessions for mental health counseling. He complied with the alcohol assessment, according to court records, and he had a deferred prosecution review for the case scheduled for 2018.Cetin\u2019s social media profile leaves few clues as to his motivations. A Facebook page widely identified as belonging to him reveals no particular political motivations or sentiments; in one image, he is seen posing next to a Buddha statue.On Twitter, Cetin makes a few political comments, in one case mentioning that he intends to vote for Hillary Clinton, However, since Cetin is not a U.S. citizen, he would appear to have been making the comment in jest.We win I vote for Hillary Clinton\u2014 Arcan (@ArcanCetin) January 18, 2015Another comment refers to \u201cMWR,\u201d which is the acronym for \u201cmorale, welfare, recreation\u201d centers on U.S. military bases. Yet another tweet refers positively to the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).Update: Multiple sources confirm that Cetin was a Muslim, though there is no established link yet to an Islamic terror motive or organization.Though Cetin had\u00a0no known political motive or association, he did appear to mock Republicans in one tweet, referencing country music: \u201cCountry is for Republicans and confused Democrats.\u201dJoel B.
